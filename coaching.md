## Gary Says 

As a writer, I have worked with Janet Joy in several of her many roles. I have found her innovative, flexible, sensitive, enthusiastic, intelligent and articulate. She is able to help people perform at their best and offers kind, enthusiastic, inspirational facilitation and leadership. Her warm and friendly manner energizes organizations and events and her diligent, experienced and thorough planning and logistical skills ensure that festivals, events, and everything else are pulled off with finesse, genuine connection to intended audience and with aplomb. I highly recommend her for any role.

I first worked with Janet Joy as an author guest at the Mattawa River Writers Festival, where her organizational skills and passion really impressed me. I'd been to various festivals to promote my first novel and this was among the best organized. She communicated regularly and clearly about all of the details relating to my appearance there as a speaker and workshop leader. When I arrived, I found a lovely welcome package of local products as well as a detailed package that explained everything about my participation.

When she asked me to join the advisory group, I said yes without hesitation because by then I was as enthusiastic as she was about the Canadian Ecology Centre and the festival's role within its mandate. 2019 was my first year helping advise, and I joined the festival in person again. It was once again an impressive feat of organization: workshops, a silent auction, a sit-down dinner for about 100 guests, and the festival itself.

This year, she planned the festival as usual, but COVID-19 saw to it that the in-person festival had to be canceled. Undaunted, Janet Joy moved it online to a series of Zoom meetings. In a space of a few weeks, she rewrote the festival website and mastered the tools (Zoom, Eventbrite, probably others I don't know about) and made sure that the meetings were safe from unwanted intrusions. It was a Herculean task that she took on alone--planning, promotion, scheduling, hosting, and producing. Truly an impressive feat! I attended a few of the sessions myself and felt connected to the other writers, participants and nature. The session I presented was well attended and managed. I was happy to be able to be part of it. Many things have gone online during this pandemic, so it's a feat in itself to attract a respectable audience. And she did!

Janet Joy's commitment to this festival and to the twin project of Canadian literature and ecology are a thing of beauty. She's lovely to work with and would be an asset to any organization that's lucky enough to get her.

I came to Janet Joy seeking advice and direction for a nonfiction book proposal. I was not disappointed! Her extensive knowledge of the publishing industry, incisive and often humorous feedback, and gentle encouragement helped me immensely. In preparation for my appointment, she had already done thorough research in the genre in which I am writing, and so was readily able to to point out possible pitfalls ahead as well as opportunities. With her support, I was able to formulate a clear plan for taking my proposal forward to agents and publishers. I highly recommend her!
