## Gary Says 

As a writer, I have worked with Janet Joy in several of her many roles. I have found her innovative, flexible,sensitive, enthusiastic, intelligent and articulate. She is able to help people perform at their best and offers kind, enthusiastic, inspirational facilitation and leadership. Her warm and friendly manner energizes organizations and events and her diligent, experienced and thorough planning and logistical skills ensure that festivals, events, and everything else are pulled off with finesse, genuine connection to intended audience and with aplomb. I highly recommend her for any role.

## Charles Says 

I came to Janet Joy seeking advice and direction for a nonfiction book proposal. I was not disappointed! Her extensive knowledge of the publishing industry, incisive and often humorous feedback, and gentle encouragement helped me immensely. In preparation for my appointment, she had already done thorough research in the genre in which I am writing, and so was readily able to to point out possible pitfalls ahead as well as opportunities. With her support, I was able to formulate a clear plan for taking my proposal forward to agents and publishers. I highly recommend her!
