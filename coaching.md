### extensive knowledge of the publishing industry

I came to Janet Joy seeking advice and direction for a nonfiction book proposal. I was not disappointed! Her extensive knowledge of the publishing industry, incisive and often humorous feedback, and gentle encouragement helped me immensely. In preparation for my appointment, she had already done thorough research in the genre in which I am writing, and so was readily able to to point out possible pitfalls ahead as well as opportunities.
