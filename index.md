#### {{ site.about }}

Dear reader,

My life is an open book and this website is the place where I will share a variety of my passions with you:

My [favourite books]({{ site.url }}/library/)

[Adventures]({{ site.url }}/blog/) in nature

Places to [ride a bicycle]({{ site.url }}/blog/)

[Suggestions]({{ site.url }}/blog/) to try something different ...

<br />

Come along with me for a never ending story called life!

<br />

Want to see what I'll be talking about next on GLOBAL TV The Morning Show? Tune in October 20 at 8:10 am for some FRIGHTFUL FICTION!
