The Earth Day BOOK TALK was launched as a fundraiser for the CEC Educational Foundation in 2016. Authors shared how nature influenced their writing. In 2017 a family eco program was added. WORDS IN THE WOODS in 2018 included a full day of writing workshops, a family program with a children's author and our renowned Book Talk Fundraiser with keynote speaker Kate Harris.

We are branding the event to acknowledge the historic Mattawa River. We will be expanding again just as a river overflows in the spring.

Join us at the Mattawa River Writers & Arts Festival where we are creating connections with our natural world through the arts and in the river! August 18th launches from the dock Paddle and Prose with Roy MacGregor ... dip your paddle for some great Canadian stories!

Save the date for a weekend in the woods with words April 26-28 2019.
