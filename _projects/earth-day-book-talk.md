The Earth Day BOOK TALK was launched as a fundraiser for the CEC Educational Foundation in 2016. Authors shared how nature influenced their writing. In 2017 a family eco program was added. WORDS IN THE WOODS in 2018 included a full day of writing workshops, a family program with a children's author and our renowned Book Talk Fundraiser with keynote speaker Kate Harris.

Join us at the Mattawa River Writers Festival where we are creating connections with our natural world through the arts and in the river! 

Save the date for a weekend of Writers in the Woods April 26-28 2019.
