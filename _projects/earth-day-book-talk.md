The Canadian Ecology Centre hosted its inaugural Earth Day Book Talk in 2016 with three leading authors who provided a link to how nature is captured in their prose.

2017 expanded to include a Family Program and our key note speaker was Diana Beresford-Kroeger.

For the third annual Earth Day at CEC, the program will increase in length to include two days of writer's workshops, family day and the Book Talk evening! Please join us to celebrate Earth Day alongside the historic Mattawa River!
