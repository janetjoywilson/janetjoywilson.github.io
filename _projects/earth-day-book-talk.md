The Earth Day BOOK TALK was launched as a fundraiser for the CEC Educational Foundation in 2016. Authors shared how nature influenced their writing. In 2017 a family eco program was added. WORDS IN THE WOODS in 2018 included a full day of writing workshops, a family program with a children's author and our renowned Book Talk Fundraiser with keynote speaker Kate Harris.

Creating connections and awareness of the natural world through words and literacy is our mission.

We will be expanding again in 2019 and I am overJOYed to be a part of this naturally inspiring festival.
