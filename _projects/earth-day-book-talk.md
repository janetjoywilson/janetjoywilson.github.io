The Earth Day BOOK TALK was launched as a fundraiser for the CEC Educational Foundation in 2016. Authors shared how nature influenced their writing. In 2017 a family eco program was added. WORDS IN THE WOODS in 2018 included a full day of writing workshops, a family program with a children's author and our annual Book Talk Fundraiser.

Join us at the Mattawa River Writers Festival where we are creating connections with our natural world through literature. 

Pandemic Pivot: ZOOM INTO THE WOODS with our new series, In Conversation, launched in 2021!
