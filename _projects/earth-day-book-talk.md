The Canadian Ecology Centre hosted its inaugural Earth Day Book Talk in 2016 with three leading authors who provided a link to how nature is captured in their prose.

2017 expanded to include a Family Program and our key note speaker was Diana Beresford-Kroeger.

The 2018 program, now called Words In The Woods, will increase in length to include one day of writers workshops, an expanded family day program with a children's author and the Book Talk evening! Please join us to celebrate Earth Day alongside the historic Mattawa River!
