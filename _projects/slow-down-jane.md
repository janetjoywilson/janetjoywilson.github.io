The goal of this 100in1day urban intervention is to slow down traffic on one street for one day because there’s a story here and you’re missing it.

The intention is not to stop the traffic but to slow down the pace of the roadway so that everyone feels safe.

Slow Down Jane. Take a look at what's around you. Slow Down Jane. Maybe we’ll inspire you to pull over and appreciate the art that is all around you. Slow Down Jane.
