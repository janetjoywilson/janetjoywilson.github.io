Advocating for Bikeways Across Toronto to Address Community Transportation Needs 

In concert with over 120 community groups around the city, as the Toronto Community Bikeways Coalition (TCBC), weâ€™re calling on the city to implement 100 kilometres of bikeways to mirror the busiest TTC routes. By providing safe, alternative transportation options, these additional bikeways will particularly benefit transit-reliant citizens and essential workers at this vital time. 

It was formed in May 2020 by a small group of people who believe Torontonians require safe alternative transportation options, particularly during this unprecedented time as our society grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic.  I am proud to be a founding member.
