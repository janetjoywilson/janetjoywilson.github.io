I first appeared on Global TV's The Morning Show in the fall of 2014 to promote the inaugural The Reading Line's Book Ride. The second I walked into the 'green room', people wanted to talk to me about books they were reading or ask for recommendations because I was The Book Lover.

Since January 2015 I am introduced once a month on air as TMS's Resident Book Lover. I have the unique opportunity to walk into the studio with a selection of books I curate for a wide variety of tastes based on the hope of finding a book for everyone of all ages.

Reading is really important and sharing a great book is something that brings us together.
