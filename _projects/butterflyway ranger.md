Butterflyway Project has produced award-winning efforts reimagining our neighbourhoods as flower-filled corridors where wild bees and butterflies can thrive.

Training, inspiration and guidance from the nice folks at the David Suzuki Foundation. I will learn about the joys of butterflies and native wildflower gardening from experts throughout the country and get connected with a community of amazing Rangers from previous years. Then I will begin recruiting friends and neighbours to help make some magic happen, finding creative ways to establish pollinator-friendly habitat throughout my community in  2021!
