My role as Co-Captain of Cycle Toronto's Ward 13 Bike Group is to promote cycling in my community. This is both through community events to assist cyclists and increase the publicâ€™s exposure to cyclists but also at the political level to advocate for better cycling infrastructure, making cycling safer both for the well-being of present cyclists, and to encourage more people to cycle.
