My role as Co-captain of Cycle Toronto's Ward 13 Bike Group from 2014-2018 was to promote cycling in my community. We advocated for better cycling infrastructure, making cycling safer both for the well-being of present cyclists, and to encourage more people to cycle. Toronto's new ward structure has expanded the boundary and the number of volunteers working together for safer streets.
