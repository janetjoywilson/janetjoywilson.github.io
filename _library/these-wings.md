"Places and wild spaces are important to me in my work and life. Hiking, canoeing, swimming, and walking help me to write." says Kim Fahner. In her Acknowledgements she thanks the beautiful places like Killarney Provincial Park and Lake Ramsey. Kim was the fourth poet laureate of the City of Greater Sudbury (2016-18), and also the first woman to be appointed to the role. Additionally, she is a playright and novelist.

In her Notes regarding the poem "A Complicated Relationship with Landscape" she shares that she wrote this after she read the phrase in Jane Urquhart's novel, A Map of Glass. 

"The Lake Belongs to Us" is a poem written in tribute to the work Gord Downie did for Lake Ontario Waterkeeper in his role as board member. Kim said her poem is a reminder that our waters are something we need to protect and defend. 

"The Frida Poems" were inspired by her visit to the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta in 2018 along with echoes from her own past. 

It is a slim book in size but the scope - expanse - breadth of feeling - is immense.

I love this [review](http://poets.ca/2019/08/28/review-these-wings-by-kim-fahner/) which is beautifully written by Vera Constantineau. She really captures the collection of poetry's essence much better than I am able.


Open YOUR wings and soar with her poems.
