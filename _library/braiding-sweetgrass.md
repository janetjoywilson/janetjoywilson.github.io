Indigenuous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of the Plants

I am in the process of depaving my driveway to transform it into a greenway. 

As a result, I have soil instead of asphalt and I've planted a [Three Sisters Garden](https://www.evergreen.ca/downloads/pdfs/BeanKeepers-ThreeSisters.pdf) to flourish in the exposed earth. As I've been sharing this green JOYney with others, a friend recommended I read [Braiding Sweetgrass](https://milkweed.org/book/braiding-sweetgrass). I had heard of this book which was published in 2013 and always meant to read it well if not now then when?!

love love love love love it

Why? 


Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got til its gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
