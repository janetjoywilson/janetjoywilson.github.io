Indigenuous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of the Plants

I am in the process of depaving my driveway to transform it into a greenway. I am un paving a parking lot to provide a paradise again. 

As a result, I have soil instead of asphalt and I've planted a Three Sisters Garden to flourish in the earth. As I've been sharing this green JOYney, a friend recommended I read Braiding Sweetgrass. I've heard of this book which was published in 2013 and always meant to read it well if not now then when?!
