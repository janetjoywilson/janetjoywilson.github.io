How can you get your kids interested in Earth Day? Letâ€™s start with the weather with WHATEVER THE WEATHER from Roost Books. This book is full of engaging science experiments and open-ended art activities that provides a hands-on approach to exploring and understanding the weather we experience every day.

I think this book is a great starting point for families as it encourages creativity, questioning and a spirit of curiousity for you and your children. Try painting in the rain, send kites soaring in the wind, build ice orbs or become a snowflake scientist. So much to do whatever the weather.
