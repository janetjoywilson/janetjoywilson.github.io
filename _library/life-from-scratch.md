I first read this memoir when it was in its manuscript form years ago because I was very curious as to why [National Geographic](http://books.nationalgeographic.com/books) was publishing a memoir. Their publishing program is usually big beautiful illustrated books or travel guides. I understood after reading it that it did fit their expanding program because Sasha grew up around the world. She began an ambitious quest of cooking 195 meals from 195 countries in 195 weeks and documented it on her blog called [Global Table Adventure](http://globaltableadventure.com/). This is how she caught the attention of National Geographic along with many others!

Why should you read this book?

Sasha is a beautiful writer. Her personal journey of self-acceptance and discovery shows the power of cooking to bond, to empower and to heal - and she celebrates the simple truth that happiness is created from within.

During our [Global TV The Morning Show Book Club meeting](http://globalnews.ca/video/2660120/tms-book-club-15), we shared our views on this unique memoir and I shared the gift of food from a one my favourite local restaurants called [Ro House](http://www.rohouse.ca/).

Food and books are a recipe for love.
