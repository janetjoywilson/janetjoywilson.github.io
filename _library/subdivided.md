Through compelling storytelling and analysis, SUBDIVIDED’s contributors – a wide range of place-makers, academics, activists and journalists – ask how we can expand city-building processes to tackle issues ranging from transit equity and trust-based policing to holistic mental health, dignified affordable housing and inclusive municipal governance.

[SUBDIVIDED](https://www.amazon.ca/Subdivided-City-Building-Hyper-Diversity-Jay-Pitter/dp/1552453324) aims to provoke the tough but pressing conversations required to build a truly connected and just city.
