Karen McBride dedicates this book to her father and those under the blue skies of Timiskaming.

Turn the page and she has included this quotation:

"If you talk to animals they will talk with you and you will know each other.

If you do not talk to them you will not know them, and what you do not know you will fear.

What one fears one destroys."

Chief Dan George, My Heart Soars

## Nanabush

"It's a name that has a certain weight on the tongue. A taste. Like lit sage in a windowless room. Or aluminum foil on an old filling."

Not only did Karen write a novel that is moving, magical, lyrical, and full of love but she also illustrated it!
