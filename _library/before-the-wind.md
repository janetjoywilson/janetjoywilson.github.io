"I was born and raised at the mouth of the ocean and watched boats come and go my whole young life.  Jim Lynch's Before the Wind brings me back to those shores as his song of a novel sings of both the ease and magic of the perfect sailing day and the near impossibility of surviving the worst one." â€”Alan Doyle, bestselling author of Where I Belong
