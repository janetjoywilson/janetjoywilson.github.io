FOR KIDS &/OR THE KID IN YOU!!

A variety of doodle-book activities, mazes, puzzles, and centered on images and objects from the Smithsonian [National Air & Space Museum](https://airandspace.si.edu/), with fun, informational captions and templates/guides for making paper airplanes and rockets, solar system mobiles and star charts, and your own comic book of alien encounters.

Need a backseat activity book for your kids? Want to have a discussion about the stars before you gaze skyward at the cottage? I love this book that is entertaining and highly educational for children 8-12 years of age.
