This short, practical, and inspiring book presents Buddhist wisdom on love, relationships, and finding true contentment in life. Moh Hardin shares that love is far more than merely an emotion we feel toward our partners, families, and friends; it is a way of being awake in the world, of living beyond the ego.

I think it's a perfect little book to give with love.
