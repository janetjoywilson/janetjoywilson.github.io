Kids will be entertained by this coloring and activity book that lets them get creative about geography and world cultures. This oversized coloring book has tear-out pages about the size of a place mat. Hey! what a great use - take a few pages along to a restaurant and you're covered, literally.

What's in it? Animals from around the world, identify the continents on a world map, design their own kimono, or create intricate patterns on Mexican sugar skulls. It's a great mix of geography and culture in one book.

There's a lot of space to be creative in this large book. They're not just filling in the colors on countries' flags; they have a place to design their own flag. If their life's dream is to be the ruler of the world - then naming their own country and designing its flag is a great place to start.

Check out the sumptuous original children's atlas, [MAPS](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0763668966/ref=pd_cp_14_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=GNYSMD4C8F8JBGT940W9) , which is a visual feast for readers of all ages!
