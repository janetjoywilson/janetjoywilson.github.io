There is more than 100 recipes for delicious, healthy, satisfying meals to make at your campsite or in any outdoor setting.

The philosophy of Campfire Cuisine is LIVE TO EAT so why not at a campsite? I know how hungry I am after a day of canoeing or hiking and to eat great food makes the entire experience even better!

Let me paint the picture:

For breakfast upon waking to the songs of the birds, have a decadent Bananas Foster French Toast.

Go for a hike, swim, paint a scenery a la Group of Seven and then unpack your pre-made Curried Chicken Sandwiches & / or a  Grilled Veg salad with Goat Cheese.

For the afternoon go exploring. Look under a fallen branch. Do a little yoga in the woods and under a starry sky savour Grilled Steak Tacos paired with a pinot noir.

This outdoor dining experience can be yours!! Food can be pre-made and then just warmed up at your campsite.

Tips for shopping, storing, packing, choosing the right camp stove, making ahead & much more are in this travel worthy cookbook. All recipes here take mere minutes of prep use minimal ingredients & delicious enough that youâ€™ll want to serve at home.
