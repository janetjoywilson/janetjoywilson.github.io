## [my 10 favourite books](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/donna-tartt)

Into the eleventh month of the Pandemic (Feb 2021), I have lots of time to read! There are as many words to describe this novel as number of accolades! 

Massively entertaining! Extraordinary. An astonishing achievement. Wholly entertaining. A rare literary page turner. Brilliant. A  triumph. Astonishing Dickensian novel. Darkly funny. Greatest literary escape. A beautiful, painful, unexpectedly uplifting work of art. Intoxicating. The Goldfinch is nearly perfect in its construction. Hauntingly beautiful novel. Rare novel. An out and out dazzler. A noirish thriller and an epic love story, a philosophical inquiry into the value of art, and a brooding meditation on loss, addictiton, and the uselessness of being true to oneself when that self turns out to be significantly flawed.
