For parents who will celebrate a child’s graduation from kindergarten I suggest a sweet board book called LITTLE ONE STEP that all adults will enjoy reading again and again and again … it’s a wonderful life lesson that every journey begins with one little step as the older brothers tell their littlest brother in this charming story.
