"A thrillingly exhilarating adventure and glorious coming-of-age story, rich in both imagination and history, in perception and truth. I couldn't put the book down."--Donald Sutherland

Grounded in real pirate history: Captain Johnson helps Jim with his homework by telling him the true stories of historical pirates from the Golden Age of Piracy (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), including Sir Francis Drake, Captain Kidd, and Blackbeard. Through the captain's stories, the boy sees how the history he learned in school doesn't tell the whole story and how it's often difficult to judge who is a hero and who is a villain.

The book includes fifty line drawings of old-fashioned maritime subjects [by the author](http://www.gilkersonart.com/), an internationally known painter of maritime art.

But due to his talents, I managed to have [FROM ROCKS TO ROCKETS](https://www.amazon.ca/Rocks-Rockets-humorous-history-warfare/dp/184603423X), his first book, published in a smaller format by Osprey.
