The most organized woman in the world provides a simple and easy to following ode to decluttering.

[The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](https://www.amazon.ca/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308) challenges you to ask yourself whether each object you have is achieving a purpose. Does it spark joy?  Its strength is in its simplicity.

Here's some feedback from friends:

Orielle from Ajax, Ontario said … “Marie Kondo’s book was uplifting and invigorating. I woke up bright and early the next month, emptied all my drawers, my closet and all of the boxes of clothes in my basement. I went through each item and only kept the ones that “sparked joy”. After filling three large garbage bags, I could see the floor to my closet and actually had extra space in my drawers.”

Lynne  from Vaughan, Ontario said … “With its simplistic and charming writing it made something undesirable become more approachable.”

Dorothy from Toronto, Ontario said… “The simple, low stress approach reignited my desire to purge myself of the unnecessary clutter. My fiance is thrilled he now has a drawer in my closet.”

Pascale from Montreal, Quebec said… “I think this book is perfect for 2016. Live with less, live in harmony with my house, and live in stress-free environment are goals I am trying to achieve. The every day clutter in my place makes me stressed, and it would be a clutter easy to eliminate. This book is right on that journey.”
