This is a psychological thriller with a terrible crime at its core.

It's about the love of a wife and husband and the dark spaces that exist between that relationship. It is a compelling read as you never quite know what turn the story is going to take with a pacing that will take your breath away!

I’m always curious as to where an author’s idea for a book comes from. Barton says this about The Widow… “The worm of this book infected me long ago when, as a national newspaper journalist covering notorious crimes and trials, I found myself wondering what the wives of those accused really knew – or allowed themselves to know.”    

What would you do for love?
