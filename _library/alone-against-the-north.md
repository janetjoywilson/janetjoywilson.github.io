“Rare insight into the heart and mind of an explorer, and the insatiable hunger for the unknown that both inspires and drives one to the edge. Adam Shoalts, twenty-first-century explorer, calmly describes the things he has endured that would drive most people to despair, or even madness.”
—Col. Chris Hadfield, astronaut, author, space station commander

I had the pleasure of spending some time with [Adam Shoalt](http://adamshoalts.com/) when he participated in [The Canadian Ecology Centre](http://www.canadianecology.ca/)'s inaugural [Earth Day Book Talk](http://www.canadianecology.ca/spring-eventspackages/earth-day-book-talk/) celebrating Earth Day in 2016. He is an extraordinary modern day "Indiana Jones".

This book is perfect for the adventurer in you without the bug bites.
