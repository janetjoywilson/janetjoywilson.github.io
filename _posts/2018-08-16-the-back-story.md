## a passion project

The origin story goes like this ... I saw [Amanda Lewis](https://theamandalewis.com/) walk into the [Cycle Toronto](https://www.cycleto.ca/) Ward Captain's meeting and thought ... She is a book person. So am I. She is a bicycle advocate. So am I. We should put this together.

I remember us meeting after work at St. James Park. We had an embarrassment of ideas because to us books and bicycles go together like peanut butter and jelly.

We continued talking after our mini picnic meeting. We got more excited. We then met at the Dark Horse Espresso Bar and within an hour we had a name, a date and a program!

Today. Amanda lives in Vancouver. I live in Toronto. Our sixth Book Ride is about to kick into gear. I can't believe this is our fifth year!

The first three years we had ZERO money. NADA. Zilch. NONE. We had da best authors who agreed to ride and read for love, hugs and chocolate. In 2017, we spent hours researching and writing a grant application for Toronto Arts Council and Ontario Arts Council. The Reading Line is a non-profit but not registered. We do not have a Board of Directors. etc.  Toronto Arts Council gave us money! Ontario Arts Council did not. We hired two young men with the TAC funding. We paid our authors. We developed a relationship with a graphic design company who were book lovers and cyclists and gave us a non-profit discount. We amplified our efforts and reached 300 book loving people on bicycles!

Today we are about to embark on the largest Book Ride ever AND I am stressed more than I have ever been in my life.

## to russia with love

Stress? I put myself under stress when I applied and was accepted to speak at the World Cycling Congress in Moscow, Russia in February 2018. They said да and I immediately got shingles! But I recovered and I traveled to snowy Moscow and killed it at a venue next to Gorky Park!

Sharing The Reading Line's mission of making our city a better place, one street and one book at a time was incredibly satisfying. This concept is possible in cities around the world.

I am saying here ... this is MY last Toronto Book Ride. Why? Toronto has so much happening here. We don't need to continue a Book Ride on the streets of Toronto. I think taking the concept to other cities in an open source format allows for sharing and building community! It is also sustainable and scaleable unlike the current structure.
