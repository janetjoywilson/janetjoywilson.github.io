I was asked by [Back Roads Bill](http://www.steerto.com/) for a list of books that would be great gifts for those who live in Northern Ontario. He wanted to share these books during his regular segment on [CBC Morning North](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/programs/morningnorth) with [Markus Schwabe](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/morning-north-1.3123307) so I curated a library that have obvious links to our north and its environment but also books for all of us!

<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i> Here's our conversation December 6, 2016 on CBC Morning North [Books for the Back Roads](http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/825912899683/ ) on December 6th.

## a memoir for the ADVENTURER in your life

[ALONE AGAINST THE NORTH](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/alone-against-the-north-an/9780143193975-item.html?ikwsec=Books&ikwidx=0) by [Adam Shoalts](http://adamshoalts.com/about/bio/)

Anyone who was fortunate enough to spend an evening with [Adam Shoalts](http://adamshoalts.com/about/bio/) at [The Canadian Ecology Centre](http://www.canadianecology.ca/)'s inaugural [Earth Day Book Talk](http://www.canadianecology.ca/spring-eventspackages__trashed/earth-day-book-talk/) in April knows that the age of exploration is not over.

You’ve heard the phrase: where there’s a will, there’s a way. Well consider the iron will of Adam. He is an explorer and a trail blazer trained as a cartographer, historian and archeologist. Basically he can do it all!  

[ALONE AGAINST THE NORTH](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/alone-against-the-north-an/9780143193975-item.html?ikwsec=Books&ikwidx=0) is his determined story of finding the Again River. What Shoalts discovered as he paddled downriver appeared in no satellite imagery or map: a series of waterfalls that could easily have killed him. Just as astonishing was the media reaction when he got back to civilization. He was crowned ["Canada's Indiana Jones"](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/authors/275487/adam-shoalts) and was feted by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and congratulated by the governor general. Shoalts had proved that the world is bigger than we think.

He writes a gripping and often poetic classic adventure story of single-minded obsession, physical hardship, and the restless sense of wonder that every explorer has in common. Shoalts's story makes it clear that the world can become known only by getting out of our cars and armchairs, and setting out into the unfamiliar, where every step is different from the one before and something you may never have imagined lies around the next curve in the river.

I hope this true life adventure story inspires you to make your own discoveries in nature.

## for the MAPLE SYRUP lover

[MAPLE](http://www.quirkbooks.com/book/maple) by [Katie Webster](https://www.amazon.ca/Maple-Sweet-Savory-Recipes-Featuring/dp/1594748047)

Ever since [Back Roads Bill](http://www.steerto.com/) gave me a big jug of maple syrup I’ve been looking for a variety of ways to use it as I have to confess I don’t like pancakes.

Did you know that maple syrup is paleo, vegan friendly & naturally gluten free so most everyone can enjoy maple syrup and many of the 100 recipes in the book.

Have you eaten breakfast today? If not, try one of these recipes from the book: Maple Cranberry Walnut Granola, Steel-cut Oats Banana Walnut Bowls  or Maple Sweet Potato Coffee Cake.

At lunch dip into Soups, Side Dishes, and Salads like Carrot Ginger Soup with Maple Yogurt, Slow Cooker Chicken Thigh Hot Pot	or Sweet Potato and Peanut Soup.

For dinner the Main Courses include Maple Wheat Pizza Dough, simple Maple Ginger Chicken Thighs or Vermonter Quesadillas with Maple Cream.

And of course there’s Desserts like Maple apple crumb pie, for Christmas some Maple Shortbread Cookies or Maple lemon squares.

PLUS there’s Drinks including Maple Peach Old Fashioned and a  Mapletini!
A jar of maple syrup is a great gift BUT a jar of maple syrup with a beautiful, comprehensive cook book about what to do with it is even better.

## a must read

[WENJACK](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/549816/wenjack#9780735233386) a novella by [Joseph Boyden](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/authors/149986/joseph-boyden)

Chanie Wenjack died 50 years ago in October 2016: The Ojibwa boy froze by the side of Northern Ontario train tracks after running away from a residential school. Although his death resulted in Canada’s first inquiry into the practice of removing indigenous children from their families, the 12-year-old’s story isn’t common knowledge.

This novella is written by Scotiabank Giller Prize–winning author Joseph Boyden and beautifully illustrated by acclaimed artist Ken Monkman, Boyden feels that this powerful book should be read even in grade school. He doesn’t think grade seven or eights are too young to read the story, but grandparents aren’t too old to read this book.

Boyden “wants us as Canadians to understand the fuller history of our country, to take it upon him or herself to learn beyond what you weren’t taught in school. And the importance of that. It’s not so we feel guilty or bad for what people we never met did, it’s beyond that. It’s how do we come together as a nation and move forward together.”

![mysterious creatures Picture]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/mysterious creatures.jpg)

## for Bills’s stocking:

[MYSTERIOUS CREATURES](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/538299/mysterious-creatures#9781578266388) by [Leighanna Hoyle](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/authors/2135764/leighanna-hoyle)

This is a Cryptid Coloring Book and Field Reference Guide containing 20+ illustrations of legendary and mythical creatures known as cryptids.

[What’s a CRYPTID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids) you ask?! A cryptid is any creature that may or may not exist. Their existence has been reported, but there has not been any proof they are real. For example, the Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster, and more. This unique coloring book is both informative and fun. Details on these mysterious creatures are laid out in a field guy sort of way alongside wonderful illustrations of how they might look like.

[Back Roads Bill](http://www.steerto.com/) is a kid at heart so this book is perfect for him but also young children will appreciate the fun of taking a coloring book page and making it their own. A great stocking stuffer as it offers creativity and an outlet for their own imagination during the holidays.
