## Goodbye 2016

It’s almost the end of the year when The Best of lists are released and New Year’s Resolutions are announced.

I thought I’d take a few sentences to reflect on a full year as it has had some profound moments for me andt that's really all I can write about, right?

## winter

I marked the anniversary of the one-year legal separation from a twenty-year marriage / twenty-five-year friendship. What did I do? I went on a ten day silent Vipassana Meditation Course. I wrote about an extraordinary experience [here](http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/jsquaredink/7/tpod.html).

Do you know Joan Didion’s book [THE YEAR OF MAGICAL LIVING](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7815.The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking)? I read it after my father died in 2006. I could have and maybe should have reread it after I separated from Rob to remind myself of the emotional journey I’d be on.

Making change is hard. Making change that affects others is 100 times more difficult. I made a decision, took action and now live every day with the results.

## spring

Planning and executing [The Reading Line](http://thereadingline.ca/)’s third annual Book Ride felt like I was trying to pedal as fast as I could and I still couldn’t get anywhere. We did indeed have a successful event on a very hot day but it did not reach the attendance I had hoped.

## summer

In the summer I participated in the [Cycling for Libraries first Canadian tour](http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/jsquaredink/8/tpod.html) located in Southern Ontario. It was an amazing journey on bicycle with an amazing group of individuals from twelve countries! See details from the trip here.

## fall

I returned to [Vipassana Meditation Centre][(http://www.torana.dhamma.org/)] to give my time. The centre is maintained by volunteers and I cleared the brush and meditated. Exactly what I need in October.

## winter

I traveled to [Guatemala to volunteer on a Habitat for Humanity](http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/jsquaredink/9/tpod.html) build. Two days before flying I had my first mammogram and received the call saying the radiologist wanted me to return for an ultrasound.  F**k! I did not think about this at all during my trip. I did not. Okay. Maybe occasionally.

I returned to Canada on DEC 18 and on the 19th I was back at Women’s College Hospital to find out I have a cyst in my right breast. I instinctually named it [Cyd Charisse](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001998/). Let’s continue dancing together Cyd!

Being off balance is okay. It's good actually. Let's go!
