I was named after two women my parents met during a trip to England in 1960. 

History unfolds as I turn the pages of a disintegrating photo album  ... their life before me.

I had the pleasure of spending time with Janet on her farm outside of London in 1987. I'd graduated from univesity and was exploring the world. It was a student's backpack life staying in hostels and having an adventure using a Eurail Pass.

I did not get to connect with Joy, I don't remember why, but I feel that's the woman or possibly the word I've felt most aligned with during my life. 

#Distance

Social distancing or rather a physical separation during Coronavirus.
