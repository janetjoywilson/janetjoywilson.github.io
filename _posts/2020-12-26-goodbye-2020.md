## twitch

I have a twitch to try something new. I enJOY change albeit this year may have had more changes that I could handle!

Moving forward I'm going to try a new platform. It may not be the right one. I won't know unless I try it for a while.

Do you make resolutions? 

I do sometimes. I certainly feel the need to write a resolution for 2021. But only something I can control which is how I react to others, events and the future. 

I picked up [Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/sunday/closing-the-office-of-religious-freedom-students-rate-their-universities-don-francks-the-enduring-power-of-1.3520034/the-meaningful-man-a-one-hour-special-1.3520040?x-eu-country=false) this morning. 

Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argued that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.

Frankl’s theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (“meaning”) holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.

## find meaning in it

An interesting [article](https://www.goskills.com/Soft-Skills/Resources/Top-10-new-years-resolutions) on the Top 10 Most Common New Year's Resolutions (and How to Follow Through on Them). Number 6 is "Write Down Your Goals" which I absolutely agree with because you have to choose your words and by writing it down, it's a real commitment ... to you.

Setbacks can happen, but so long as they are handled correctly, they will not impact the big goal. The key is to avoid a defeatist attitude at all costs, i.e. “Well I screwed up once, why should I even try to do this anymore.” 

This morning's live streaming on TWITCH was crappy whereas yesterday was a total feel good experience. What can I do differently? ... mmmm ... keep my intention - ban negativity - hope for the best! 

Easier said than done.

I wish you and yours a JOYful new year!

Peace be with you.
