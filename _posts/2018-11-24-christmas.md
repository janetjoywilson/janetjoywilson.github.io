## Becoming

I am listening to [Michelle Obama](https://becomingmichelleobama.com/) and I have never enjoyed an audiobook as much as this one! She is a warm and articulate narrator. Her story is engaging, funny, charming, enlightening, inspiring and honest. This audiobook is perfect for everyone!!

In her memoir there is reflection and compelling storytelling from the South Side of Chicago to Washington. I identified with her balancing the demands of motherhood and work. I loved the warmth in her voice when she shared the beginning of her relationship with Barack. When she finally told me they kissed – I swooned. It was so romantic. Then later her honesty with her miscarriage and IVF sessions. She invited me into her public and private world and although I admired her before NOW I am an even larger fan for her continued work for a positive future.

Michelle inspires me further with her [Let’s Move!](https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/) initiative dedicated to solving the problem of obesity within a generation, so that children born today will grow up healthier and able to pursue their dreams.

And recently, [The Global Girls Alliance](https://www.obama.org/globalgirlsalliance/ The Global Girls Alliance, a program of the Obama ), a program of the Obama Foundation, seeks to empower adolescent girls around the world through education, allowing them to achieve their full potential and transform their families, communities, and countries. They engage people around the world to take action to help adolescent girls and the grassroots leaders working to educate them.

Acquire the book or the audiobook (my preferred format) and go high when they go low e v e r y  d a y.

## go Dutch

A Dutch oven is the most versatile pot in your kitchen: a soup pot, a deep fryer, a braiser, a roaster, an enclosed bread oven, and the perfect vessel for one-dish meals.

I keep a cookbook on my shelf if there are a minimum of 10 recipes that I will make, not once but over and over again.

I pulled my Dutch Oven out of the basement cupboard over a year ago and use it all the time now! I was thrilled to start turning pages of [Cook It In Your Dutch Oven](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/product/9781945256561-item.html?s_campaign=goo-Shopping_All_Products_RLSA&ds_rl=1254699&ds_rl=1254699&ds_rl=1254699&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxNnfBRDwARIsAJlH29DIGCRzR5l24hjos01GAfzMLrazaVVajCLCajCGKhrc-V_PUODOQkAaAh5iEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and amazed that there are dozens of recipes I will absolutely make.

This cookbook contains great weeknight recipes but also deep frying and artisanal bread baking. PLUS a range of desserts.

Give this book and a Dutch Oven as a house warming or a graduation gift – you’ll be invited over and over again to enjoy the fruits of their labour.
