I invested in a solo canoe during the summer of 2020.

## why?

After my annual backcountry canoe trip with five amazing women from northern Ontario I reflected during my drive back to the ciyt. I was revelling in feeling restored! I hadn't realized how much the pandemic had depleted my strength not only physical but mental.

As I was nearing Toronto on the dreaded highway 400 I thought "why can't I continue canoeing?". I live next to the Humber River. There are solo canoes! So the hunt began. I of course started with used canoes. Oh gosh I found some crazy DIY solo canoes, along with too heavy, too long, too expensive, until I found the one that was just right. I'm a Goldilocks and the three canoes kinda story.

 I had permieters you see. I even drove my rental car all the way to London Ontario to check out some canoes! Nothing there was right BUT I learned a lot. They suggested I go to [The Complete Paddler](https://completepaddler.ca/) in Etobicoke. hahahaha so close yet so far! Back I drove dreaming of a little canoe of my own.

The woman at [The Complete Paddler](https://completepaddler.ca/) really listened to what I was looking for! I left the shop that day having bought a solo canoe from [NORTHSTAR CANOES](https://northstarcanoes.com/) that met all my requirements.

## delivery in december

I had to wait till December for delivery. I was going to take it out for a trip that month but thankfully I listened to my son who said wait till it's warmer.

He is wise beyond his years while I'm not! I waited and I'm glad because the water in the spring was cold enough as I stepped into it numerouse times. But first, let me tell me about my boat!

## specifications

The [ADK Lt](https://northstarcanoes.com/canoe/adk-lt/) is so light that it floats on top of the water. 

All Aramid. NORTHSTAR CANOES proprietary yellow and black makes a stunning moir√© pattern. Full wet bag minimizes resin and creates the lightest weight canoe available. Foam core, ribs and internal reinforcements make a stiff, efficient hull. The choice of flat-water paddlers everywhere. Exterior resin coated for maximum weight savings.

Length is 10 feet 6 inches and it weighs 18lbs 

I love wood so I upgraded. oiled white ash gunwales; sculpted and laminated black walnut and ash end decks; walnut and ash laminated contoured web seats hung on walnut trusses; walnut and ash laminated thwarts and yoke; stem mounted tie down loops. Laminated black walnut and ash creates a distinctive and refined canoe that is stronger and lighter. Wood trim added 2-3 lbs per canoe.

## inaugural voyage

First I had to name my canoe. 

After talking to it for a while, I decided on NOVA. Borrowed from New Latin, "newly visible star or nebula" (probably originally as ellipsis of nebula nova, later taken as ellipsis of stella nova "new star"), from feminine of Latin novus "new".
