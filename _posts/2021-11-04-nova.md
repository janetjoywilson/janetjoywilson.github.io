I invested in a solo canoe in the summer of 2020.

## why?

I had returned from my annual backcountry canoe trip with five amazing women from northern Ontario. As I was driving south back to Toronto I was revelling in feeling restored! I hadn't realized how much the pandemic had depleted my strength not only physical but mental.

As I was nearing Toronto on the dreaded highway 400 I thougtht "why can't I continue canoeing?". I live next to the Humber River. There are solo canoes! So the hunt began. Used canoes. Oh some crazy DIY solo canoes. Too heavy canoes. Too long. I had permieters you see. I even drove my rental car all the way to London Ontario to see some canoes! Was then directed to The Complete Paddler in Etobicoke. hahahaha

The woman who listened to me really listened! I left the shop having paid for a solo canoe from Northern Canoes meeting my requirements for length and weight.

## delivery in december

I had to wait till December for delivery. I was going to take it out for a trip that month but thankfully I listened to my son who said wait till it's warmer.

He is wise beyond his years and I'm not!
