On February 20th, 2016 I had the good fortune to launch the Global TV The Morning Show Book Club! I then shared with everyone a deep dark secret.

What was it?

I have never been a member of a Book Club!

I love taking risks and because I’d worked in the book industry for almost 25 years suggesting books to my friends, family, colleagues and strangers I felt I was qualified.
But I don’t like clubs! I didn’t want the TMS Book Club to be an exclusive thing – I wanted it to be inclusive – yet everyone knows what a Book Club is so I didn’t try to reinvent the title.

What was my motivation?

My goal was to find a book that was enjoyable, interesting, provocative and fun for everyone.

Why did I choose The Life We Bury by Allen Eskens as my first TMS Book Club pick?

Well, the story goes that when I was in Florida at the RH Sales Conference in 2014 and a number of respected Sales Representatives had read the manuscript and loved it! Their enthusiasm prompted me to download the novel onto my iPad. I ended up reading it in three nights.

This debut novel begins as a family drama and moves effortlessly into a cold case mystery and finishes as a chilling finger-nail-biting-read-by-the-seat-of-your-pants thriller. 

I thought it would make an ideal first novel for us to discuss because it was damn good! It had lots of stuff to talk about, the main character is an average Joe and it was written by a man. I really want this Book Club to be for women and men so I’m looking for novels that are appealing to guys as well.
I asked Allen Eskens to share with me his writing technique as he practices law as a criminal defense attorney during the day so he has to be efficient when he writes. He told me he writes in the evenings and weekends, usually trying to get a chapter or two completed by Saturday and then spending the day editing. He is a “big outliner”. He creates a fairly comprehensive plot outline before he sits down to type. He also uses a sketch pad when he outlines. It’s more visual and then he can plot points on it in a less linear fashion.  I think after you read The Life We Bury you’ll understand that it is so well done because it is incredibly well crafted and paced.

Watch our conversation.

Since I read The Life We Bury, there is a second book The Guise Of Another AND on October 11th The Heavens May Fall released! Instead of binging on Netflix, may I recommend a deadly trio of mystery/thriller books from Allen!
