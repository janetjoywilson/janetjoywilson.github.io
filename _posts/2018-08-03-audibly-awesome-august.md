## audiobooks are awesome

I remember when it was called books on tape. Yes, I know I'm dating myself but I played cassette tapes and OMG here's a memory ... my brother had a car with a 8 Track Tape in it that always played Meatloaf's Bat out of Hell. haha

If you tell a friend you're listening to an audiobook do they say "That's not really reading." Listening to a book is different than reading yourself but the content of the book's message is still conveyed.

Audiobooks have traditionally been used in schools by teachers of second-language learners, learning-disabled students, and struggling readers or nonreaders. In many cases, audiobooks have proven successful in providing a way for these students to access literature and enjoy books.

Why do I love audiobooks?

Audiobooks promote literacy!

For those of us who work with words, here are some numbers: audio increases reading accuracy by 52%, improves comprehension by 76%, test scores are increased by 21% when engaged in multi-modal learning versus single-mode and combining print and audio increases recall 40% over print alone.

Children who are better listeners are also better learners.

85% of what we learn, we learn by listening. Combining print & audio increases recall 40% over print alone. Pretty impressive numbers let alone listening to great stories by skilled readers is fun!

Quality narration is what elevates the audiobook listening experience from the print reading experience. People say it's more "emotionally engaging" than even stories in the mediums of film and television.

## the future is connected

Connected devices and spaces are becoming more mainstream, and with them, new listening opportunities in new environment. The recent adoption of smartwatches, smart home speakers and other connected devices, audiobooks are able to integrate with people’s lifestyles more than ever before.

Audio is available for download or streaming wherever audiobooks are available. Each retailer has their own formats, and some provide files in both MP3 and WAV. I use  [OverDrive](https://help.overdrive.com/customer/portal/articles/1529341-what-is-overdrive-) which is a free service offered by the [Toronto Public Library](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/). Every OverDrive collection is slightly different because each library or school picks the digital content they want for their users.

I like to play an audiobook while I'm cooking in the kitchen don't you? Or are you more in the car or while walking?

The humble act of putting one foot in front of the other transcends age, geography, culture, and class, and is one of the most economical and environmentally responsible
modes of transit. Yet with our modern fixation on speed, this healthy pedestrian activity has been largely left behind.

At a personal and professional crossroads, writer, editor, and obsessive walker [Dan Rubinstein](https://borntowalk.org/about/) travelled throughout the U.S., U.K., and Canada to walk with people who saw the act not only as a form of transportation and recreation, but also as a path to a better world. There are no magic-bullet solutions to modern epidemics like obesity, anxiety, alienation, and climate change. But what if there is a simple way to take a step in the right direction?

## Born to Walk

Combining fascinating reportage, eye-opening research, and Rubinstein’s own discoveries, [Born to Walk](https://ecwpress.com/products/born-to-walk) explores how far this ancient habit can take us, how much repair is within range, and guarantees that you’ll never again take walking for granted.

<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i> 10 hours & 55 minutes with narrator  [Braden Wright](http://www.bradenwright.com/) who will help you put one foot in front of the other!

[Evan Munday](http://idontlikemundays.com/) has written an engaging book with a resilient heroine, a dead but lively supporting case and enough wit to grease the wheels says Kirkus Reviews.  He has a unique brand of funny and your teenagers will love this geeky pop culture tale.

## Dead Kid Detective

Thirteen-year-old October Schwartz is new in town, and short on friends. Naturally, she spends most of her time in the Sticksville Cemetery, which just happens to border her
backyard. And that backyard just happens to be the home of five dead teenagers, each from a different era of the past: there’s the dead United Empire Loyalist! The dead escaped slave who made her way north via the Underground Railroad! The dead quintuplet!

Soon, October befriends the five dead kids. Together — using October’s smarts and the dead kids’ abilities to walk through walls and get around undetected and stuff — they
form [The Dead Kid Detective Agency](https://ecwpress.com/products/dead-kid-detective-agency), committed to solving Sticksville’s most mysterious mysteries. October’s like Nancy Drew, if she’d hung out with corpses.

When Sticksville Central High School’s beloved French teacher dies in a suspicious car accident, it provides the agency with its first bona fide case. Soon October and her
five dead friends find themselves in the midst of a nefarious murder plot, thick with car chases, cafeteria fights, sociopathic math teachers, real estate appointments, and a wacky adventure that might uncover the truth about a bomb that exploded almost 40 years ago.

## Starlight

The final novel from Richard Wagamese, the bestselling and beloved author of [Indian Horse](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/indian-horse/9781553654025-item.html?ikwid=indian+horse&ikwsec=Home&ikwidx=0) and [Medicine Walk](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/medicine-walk/9780771089213-item.html?ikwid=medicine+walk&ikwsec=Home&ikwidx=0), centers on an abused woman on the run who finds refuge on a farm owned by an Indigenous man with wounds of his own. A profoundly moving novel about the redemptive power of love, mercy, and compassion and the land's ability to heal us.

[Starlight](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/starlight/9780771070846-item.html?ikwid=starlight&ikwsec=Home&ikwidx=0) was unfinished at the time of Richard Wagamese's death, yet every page radiates with his masterful storytelling, intense humanism, and insights that are as hard-earned as they are beautiful. With astonishing scenes set in the rugged backcountry of the B.C. Interior, and characters whose scars cut deep even as their journey toward healing and forgiveness lifts us, Starlight is a last gift to readers from a writer who believed in the power of stories to save us.

McClelland & Stewart Senior Editor Anita Chong said: "When Richard Wagamese died in March 2017, we lost one of our great writers. While it is tragic that Richard did not have the chance to complete what was clearly his masterpiece, what he accomplished in the pages of Starlight is deserving of celebration. And we can't imagine a more fitting tribute to Richard Wagamese, a man who believed in the healing power of story, than to share his majestic last novel with readers."
