## audiobooks are awesome

I remember when it was called Books On Tape. Yes, I know I'm dating myself but I played cassette tapes and OMG here's a memory ... my brother had a car with a 8 Track Tape in it that always played Meatloaf's Bat out of Hell. haha

If you tell a friend you're listening to an audiobook do they say "That's not really reading." Listening to a book is different than reading yourself but the content of the book's message is still conveyed.

Audiobooks have traditionally been used in schools by teachers of second-language learners, learning-disabled students, and struggling readers or nonreaders. In many cases, audiobooks have proven successful in providing a way for these students to access literature and enjoy books.

Why do I love audiobooks?

Audiobooks promote literacy!

For those of us who work with words, here are some numbers: audio increases reading accuracy by 52% and  improves comprehension by 76%.

Children who are better listeners are also better learners.

85% of what we learn, we learn by listening. Combining print & audio increases recall 40% over print alone. Pretty impressive numbers let alone listening to great stories by skilled readers is fun!

Quality narration is what elevates the audiobook listening experience from the print reading experience. People say it's more "emotionally engaging" than even stories in the mediums of film and television.

## the future is connected

Connected devices and spaces are becoming more mainstream, and with them, new listening opportunities in new environment. The recent adoption of smartwatches, smart home speakers and other connected devices, audiobooks are able to integrate with people’s lifestyles more than ever before. I like to play an audiobook while I'm cooking in the kitchen don't you? Or are you more in the car or while walking?

The humble act of putting one foot in front of the other transcends age, geography, culture, and class, and is one of the most economical and environmentally responsible
modes of transit. Yet with our modern fixation on speed, this healthy pedestrian activity has been largely left behind.

At a personal and professional crossroads, writer, editor, and obsessive walker Dan Rubinstein travelled throughout the U.S., U.K., and Canada to walk with people who saw the act not only as a form of transportation and recreation, but also as a path to a better world. There are no magic-bullet solutions to modern epidemics like obesity, anxiety, alienation, and climate change. But what if there is a simple way to take a step in the right direction?

## Born to Walk

Combining fascinating reportage, eye-opening research, and Rubinstein’s own discoveries, [Born to Walk](https://ecwpress.com/products/born-to-walk) explores how far this ancient habit can take us, how much repair is within range, and guarantees that you’ll never again take walking for granted.

[Evan Munday](http://idontlikemundays.com/ has written an engaging book with a resilient heroine, a dead but lively supporting case and enough wit to grease the wheels says Kirkus Reviews.  He has a unique brand of funny and your teenagers will love this geeky pop culture tale.

Thirteen-year-old October Schwartz is new in town, and short on friends. Naturally, she spends most of her time in the Sticksville Cemetery, which just happens to border her
backyard. And that backyard just happens to be the home of five dead teenagers, each from a different era of the past: there’s the dead United Empire Loyalist! The dead escaped slave who made her way north via the Underground Railroad! The dead quintuplet!

Soon, October befriends the five dead kids. Together — using October’s smarts and the dead kids’ abilities to walk through walls and get around undetected and stuff — they
form [The Dead Kid Detective Agency](https://ecwpress.com/products/dead-kid-detective-agency), committed to solving Sticksville’s most mysterious mysteries. October’s like Nancy Drew, if she’d hung out with corpses.

When Sticksville Central High School’s beloved French teacher dies in a suspicious car accident, it provides the agency with its first bona fide case. Soon October and her
five dead friends find themselves in the midst of a nefarious murder plot, thick with car chases, cafeteria fights, sociopathic math teachers, real estate appointments, and a wacky adventure that might uncover the truth about a bomb that exploded almost 40 years ago.

Whatever format you choose to “read” it’s all great! From a printed book, braille, tablet or audiobook!  

Go back in time to August 17, 2016 when I first told Jeff on Global TV The Morning Show about audiobooks!
