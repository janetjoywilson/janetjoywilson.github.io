# Header is BIG

I have so much to say about the header that I just wrote above me. All the things to say. Verbose.

## Slightly smaller header

This is a wee bit less important, this topic of my blog post. But I still value it.

###### Really unimportant header

People don't generally use H6s, they do exist, and you can make them, just not recommended.

I like things:

- books
- bikes
- bumblebees
- bapples
- bananas

I use [GOOGLE](google.ca) as my search engine.

I am blatantly stealing the following writing from BlogTO:

What restaurants should you eat at in wine country near Toronto? Many wineries are but a short drive away from the city and they'll let you wash away your summertime woes with lots of samples. Whether you're heading to the Niagara Region or Prince Edward Country, you should probably fill up on delicious, locally sourced food before (and after) your wine tastings.

Here are 10 places to eat along the way.

## PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY

_Drake Devonshire_
You don't need to stay at the DD if you want to eat at its lakeside restaurant. Simply make a reservation and treat yourself to brunch or dinner at the boutique hotel's aesthetically pleasing dining room. The view is spectacular and the food's not too shabby either.

East & Main
This bistro in Wellington serves up locally sourced fare for lunch and dinner. Split a bottle of red (or white) and a charcuterie board or grab a meatier main to sop up all the wine you've been drinking.

The Vic Cafe
Stop here if you're looking for a nutritious and filling breakfast or lunch. This vegetarian-friendly spot serves up espresso-based bevvies along with an assortment of brown rice bowls with delicious-sounding healthy toppings.

Norman Hardie Winery
This winery turns on its pizza oven from spring to fall to dole out thin-crust pies to visitors. You can grab one, along with a glass of wine, to eat on the patio that overlooks the vineyard - is their anything more idyllic-sounding?

Picnic PEC
This food truck, which parks at Rosehall Run winery for the summer season, packs up picnic lunches - but the offerings are better than your typical egg salad sandwiches. Preorder your grab-and-go meal and take it with you on your wine tour so you don't have to stop along the way.

BEAMSVILLE AND VINELAND

August Restaurant
This restaurant in Beamsville is open for lunch and dinner and also serves up a mean Sunday brunch. Its menu features upscale comfort food and on Wednesdays and Fridays, it waves its corkage fee so you can enjoy your meal with one of your new bottles of wine.

Inn On The Twenty
For a sumptuous farm-to-table meal, head to this boutique hotel in Jordan, Ontario. The menu boasts lots of dishes for both pescatarians and meat eaters as well as a few veggie options.

NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE

Ravine Vineyard Estate Restaurant
This farm-to-table restaurant is located right at the winery. It claims to make everything in house - it even raises its owns pigs and grows its owns vegetables - to serve up fresh and local food at lunch and dinner.

Treadwell
Your meal at Treadwell won't be cheap, but it'll hopefully be delicious. Chef Stephen Treadwell aims to serve up Niagara cuisine, meaning you'll get regional food and flavours on your plate.

Backhouse
Backhouse grows its own produce, so its farm-to-table concept is the real deal. It serves up seasonally inspired fare that pays tribute to the bounty of the region. You can order a la carte or try lots of dishes with the tasting menu.
