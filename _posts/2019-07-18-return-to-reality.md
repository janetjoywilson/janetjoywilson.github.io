After two months of travel with a backpack & carry on wheelie, it's now [back to reality](https://youtu.be/TB54dZkzZOY).

Being in the here and now is so easy while traveling for a multitude of reasons including being far from your comfort zone. When I landed in Lilongwe, Malawi on May 4th after 30 hours of travel, reality hit me. I was in Africa. I was fulfilling a dream. But how do I get navigate the airport. Currency exchange. Security. Transportation. My own exhaustion?
