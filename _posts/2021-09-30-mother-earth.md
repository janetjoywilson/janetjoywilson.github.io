In order to redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission makes the following calls to action. Read it [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/indigenous-people/aboriginal-peoples-documents/calls_to_action_english2.pdf).

In March 2018, CBC News launched [Beyond 94](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-single/beyond-94?&cta=1), a website that monitors progress on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 Calls to Action. 

Beyond 94 was the result of a year’s worth of research and interviews with survivors, stakeholders and all levels of government.

The first residential schools opened in Canada in the 1800s. They were the product of churches and the government; a collective, calculated effort to eradicate Indigenous language and culture that the commission called a policy of cultural genocide. 

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed as a means of reckoning with the devastating legacy of forced assimilation and abuse left by the residential school system. From 2008 to 2014, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard stories from thousands of residential school survivors. In June 2015, the commission released a report based on those hearings. From that came the 94 Calls to Action: individual instructions to guide governments, communities and faith groups down the road to reconciliation.

## Every Child Matters

In June 2021, the Canadian federal government declared 30 September a national statutory holiday to coincide with [Orange Shirt Day](https://www.orangeshirtday.org/).

September 30th was declared Orange Shirt Day annually, in recognition of the harm the residential school system did to children's sense of self-esteem and well being, and as an affirmation of our commitment to ensure that everyone around us matters.

## Strawberries

I planted a field of strawberries that I flippantly said was inspired by John Lennon's song [Strawberry Fields Forever](https://youtu.be/HtUH9z_Oey8) as my depaving project was inspired by Joni Mitchell's [Big Yellow Taxi](https://youtu.be/GFB-d-8_bvY).

I only learned recently the significance of the [strawberry](https://youtu.be/RSi39qSrVYI) from Indigenous elders. 

The strawberry teaches forgiveness and peace. The strawberry is shaped like a heart, and strawberries are known to the Anishinaabe as heart berries.
