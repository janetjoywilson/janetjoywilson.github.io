I love to support local businesses even when they are located in Victoria BC.

## Smoking Lily

Trish Tacoma, 46, and her co-founder, Julie Higginson, launched the business in 1996 in a four-square-metre storefront in Victoria's Old Town. In those days, the founders sewed their products themselves in a spare bedroom in Ms. Tacoma's home in Esquimalt. They'd bring their wares to town by bicycle, pedalling across the city's historic blue bridge.

Trish owes her own love of sewing to her mother, who raised seven children on her own after her husband, a milkman, died. "To make the dollar stretch, she made all of our clothes," said Trish, the second youngest in her family. As a tribute to both her parents, she named her second Victoria clothing store the Milkman's Daughter.

I was curious about the name and it seems it was inspired by Trish's ex when he got annoyed at a smoker and extinguished the cigarette in a calla lily.

I discovered Smoking Lily in this Globe and Mail [article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-albertas-top-doctor-brings-facts-and-flair-to-pandemic-updates/) when Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, wore a dress with a periodic table print. "Social scientists who study fashion diplomacy believe Dr. Hinshaw is sending coded messages. Trust science. Shop local. Women can be powerful and stylish. Come for the crisis update, stay for the style. Indeed, Toronto’s Chief Medical Officer, Eileen de Villa, is now known for her scientific prowess and sleek scarves. Someone launched a Twitter account dedicated to her scarves."

What are underlovelies? Smoking Lily has [zero waste](https://smokinglily.com/collections/zero-waste-1?page=2) items made from studio leftover bits. They say, "We can't stand the thought of throwing any scrap of fabric in the landfill so we find creative uses for every piece. We're always coming up with new things!"

Waste not, want not is what I hear in my head from my own mother.

What are [underlovelies](https://smokinglily.com/collections/zero-waste-1/products/underlovelies)?!

My new favourite underwear! No elastic to pinch or give out, soft bamboo/cotton/lyrca combination, good coverage (but waaay cuter than granny pants) and they come in excellent, ever-changing, colour and print combinations! I asked if they had any bicycle patterns to choose from and of course they did!!

These undies are one of the first items they made with their pretty studio bits, so the colour and print combinations are always different. They send you an email to let you know what's available before they ship. And it's FREE SHIPPING!
