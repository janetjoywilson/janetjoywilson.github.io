this is my story of turning grey into green & I’m not talking about my hair colour!

## who

I grew up on a small family farm in southern Ontario. I’ve lived in this house in the west end of Toronto for over 25 years. I am not a professional gardener. I have made moved plants around many times, and made many mistakes and continue to experiment as I am a life-long learner.

This land is precious and I acknowledge the land I live on is of the traditional territory of the Mississauga of New Credit, the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Huron Wendat. Tkaronto is home to many indigenous people from across Turtle Island, and I am grateful to be on this land and I intend to be a mindful steward.

##  how

Step one - RE THINK what’s around you.

![beforeANDafter]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/beforeANDafter.jpg)

Step two - BE BRAVE because unfortunately returning to natural is different. We have over manicured our green space to be monocultures with lawns and plants that aren’t native and don’t feed the insects. It's a billion dollar industry and letting nature RE WILD is free! 

## inspiration

I took inspiration from a song called BIG YELLOW TAXI, it was written, composed, and originally recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell in 1970, and released on her album Ladies of the Canyon.

Joni Mitchell received her inspiration for “Big Yellow Taxi” on a trip to Hawaii. She was looking out of her hotel window at the magnificent Pacific scenery and then shifted her gaze downward to find a parking lot. The natural beauty of Hawaii had been rudely interrupted by a slab of pavement.

She wrote:

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

I removed my parking lot to restore paradise!

## backstory:

I’ve always wanted a ‘ribbon driveway’.

WHAT IS THAT?

[Ribbon driveways](https://www.gardenista.com/posts/hardscaping-101-ribbon-driveways/?fbclid=IwAR09N2yjieCFcIjggunRBv2OYLF__X9ERAMLq6J9aIApg_5JsxT1dVzdEtY), sometimes called Hollywood driveways, usually consist of two parallel tracks paved with a hard material and separated by an unpaved area. The tracks, or ribbons, are normally a couple of feet wide with a three-foot strip between them.

![temperature]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/temperature.jpg)

Obviously, a water-permeable parking area is an environmental choice as it assists with stormwater management and mitigates heat island effect.

 ![pavers]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/pavers.jpg)

I have been car free & CARE FREE using my bicycles for transportation, one a folding acoustic and the other a pedal assist cargobike, for over two years. Looking at a driveway of asphalt 15x32’ makes a girl dream. 

## mud and meadows

In 2019 I met a landscaper who did some stone work repair for me. I found out from asking Laura questions that she has installed ribbon driveways and would love to be a part of this project. She was a source of  information, education, brute strengh, and encouragement.

![paversgreen]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/paversgreen.jpg)

I split it into two phases and I’m so glad I did because once ¼ of the pavement was gone in 2020 and I’d planted my first three Sisters garden along with other vegetables, I wanted more garden and less space allocated for parking a car. 

Along the way, while researching plants, and designs, and just having green dreams. I found Dave and Santiago who remove fences between neighbours as a community project. In between the driveways was a 50 year old chain link fence and now it’s gone. He used the metal and [upCycled](https://www.blogto.com/city/2021/01/volunteer-group-toronto-will-remove-fences-yards-free/?fbclid=IwAR1Y0tMWLpnG0vmkv6EjPcqO95WgRMMNDBBOkVhF3IFaBbVWrO6F1daTByQ) it into Bicycle Racks!!

![FenceRemove]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/FenceRemove.jpg)

My design plan now included 3 bike racks and 3 trees along the property line as a very functional ‘fence line’ that provides secure parking for my friends who use Active Transportation and The Trees are a needed addition to Toronto’s tree Canopy.

## tree canopy

The City of Toronto supports private tree planting and stewardship initiatives. Efforts to expand Toronto's urban forest constitutes a valuable investment in the city's future.

I paid for my own trees because I needed a columnar shaped tree. I choose Kindred Spirit OAK as I already had two in the backyard and they fit into a narrow property. 

 ![TreePot]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/TreePot.jpg)

I come by a love of trees honestly as my father was always planting trees. He also gave me life lessons like “ once the land is gone, it’s gone.” As a family farm who supported ourselves with what we grew, good soil was important.

All the subdivisions built on good land, made him incredibly sad. Peeling off the rich soil and covering it with asphalt and concrete and highways, that’s gone. It’s like paving over a wetland and trying to recreate is not the same. This is one reason we have a decreasing insect population which is our lifeline as it’s part of the food chain.   

So my life in the city has been about supporting parks, shoreline cleanups, and at home growing  as much food as possible. My first raised bed was and is 4x10 feet. With another 5’ up with trellis for vertical growing. Rethinking your space means seeing your opportunities not only horizontally but vertically which is ideal for small yards, balconies, or a window ledge.

## LEAF 

I’d like to tell you about LEAF. It stands for Local. Enhancement and Appreciation of Forests. I purchased my low bush blueberry and st john’s wort shrubs from them and think the organization is amazing! Their Backyard Tree Planting Program offers native trees and shrubs to property owners at a subsidized cost.

![stjohnswort]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/stjohnswort.jpg)

[LEAF](https://www.yourleaf.org/) is a non-profit organization that teaches people about trees and gets them excited about the urban forest. They  plant native species in backyards and public spaces, and educate people on how to care for trees in their communities. The focus of their work is on community engagement and tree stewardship. 
They envision healthy, vibrant communities where everyone values and cares for the urban forest.
My little depaving project has generated benefits in more way than Climate change action.

This year I am a volunteer for the David Suzuki Foundation [BUTTERFLYWAY PROJECT](https://davidsuzuki.org/press/citizen-led-butterflyway-project-aims-to-help-revive-pollinators/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ5Z171eBaP1P4I8HElEWViGEga9mpgObY8j8G1Uz195V1z4ly5WCkwaAqd-EALw_wcBa). I have learned so much this year!! My goal is to educate and encourage my neighbourhood to plant pollinator plots for a habitat highway.

From [seed](https://uharvest.ca/shop/) to food for bees!

## butterflyway

Being in the front ‘yard’ in an expanded garden has me answering questions as people walk by with their dogs, giving impromptu garden tours, and educating curious children. 

I hope to inspire others to Rethink their space. That one, two, three cars do not need an entire driveway of asphalt. A Ribbon Driveway will support the vehicle and provide space for plants.

Red Clover could be sown for the bees! I’ve planted. Strawberries in the middle so that kids can come and pick them! Remember I don’t have a car so this space is 99% of the time filled with with fruit, moss on the pavers, thyme and more! Guest Parking here during a pandemic is nil!

I now have dozens of native plants, pollinators, new trees, fruit and vegetables and growing a community who is more aware of environmental options. 

![milkweed]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/milkweed.jpg)

They smile when they look at my colourful Butterflyway which they didn’t when it was a grey Driveway.  

Thank you for bee-ing here with me during Pollinator Week!

I hope I’ve planted a SEED in you to look at new (old) Ways You can help expand the butterflyway as every native plant you put In the ground whether i’s in your Yard or in a pot on balcony. Just do it!
