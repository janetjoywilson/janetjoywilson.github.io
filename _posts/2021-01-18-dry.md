## dry January

The roads have been dry here during the first month of January. So dry I thought I'd begin the new year on January 11th - e v e r y o n e starts on the 1st - and abstain from alcohol. There are a lot of articles with [TIPS](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tips-to-make-your-dry-january-successful) on how to make a plan and stick to it! 

Dry January is only 31 days but my intention is to continue. 

Why?

Because.
