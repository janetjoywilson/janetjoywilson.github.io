## dry January

The roads have been dry here during the first month of January. So dry I thought I'd begin the new year on January 11th - e v e r y o n e starts on the 1st - and abstain from alcohol. There are a lot of articles with [TIPS](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tips-to-make-your-dry-january-successful) on how to make a plan and stick to it! I didn't read any of them.

Instead, I wrote in my journal. 

"dear Janet. You do have CONTROL of what you do. I ask you Janet. What do you want?"

Dry January is only 31 days but my intention is to continue. 

Why?

Because I'm tired of wasting my nights with a bottle of wine and a bowl of popcorn.
Because I've gained wine weight.
Because I'm afraid.

## salt

Today is special.

When I was traveling around the world in 2019, I would say "if not now, when?" 

Why am I not treating today like Maldon Sea Salt Flakes?
