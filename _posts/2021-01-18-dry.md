## dry January

The roads have been dry here during the first month of January. So dry I thought I'd begin the new year on January 11th - e v e r y o n e starts on the 1st - and abstain from alcohol. There are a lot of articles with [TIPS](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tips-to-make-your-dry-january-successful) on how to make a plan and stick to it! I didn't read any of them.

Instead, I wrote in my journal. 

"dear Janet. You do have CONTROL of what you do. I ask you Janet. What do you want?"

Dry January is only 31 days but my intention is to continue. 

Why?

Because I'm tired of wasting my nights with a bottle of wine and a bowl of popcorn.
Because I've gained wine weight.
Because I'm afraid.

## salt

THIS  DAY  is not going to come back. 

When I was traveling around the world in 2019, I would say "if not now, when?" 

Why am I not treating today like Maldon Sea Salt Flakes?

Well, I can. And, I will.

I invested in a pedal asist cargo bicycle last fall. I named it MARK because I live in a valley and St Marks Hill Road is steep hill that I pedal up most every day. I knew if I was to "age in place" then I needed help UP that hill! 

Additionally, when I get on this bicycle, I say "On your Mark, get set, GO!" and boy o boy do we go! It's an incredible carGObike!

## the hat

I bought this hat for myself a few years ago. That night I met a friend and we went to the theatre. Gosh. I hope that can happen again! 

I wore my hat and relived that evening that was special.
