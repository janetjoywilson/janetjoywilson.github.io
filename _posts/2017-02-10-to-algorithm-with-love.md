## Love is like jumping off a cliff!

![cliff Picture]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/cliff.jpg)

Why would I write that? Because I had this great photo from a trip to Whistler a few years ago that I wanted to use. Additionally, the first time you say “I love you” feels like the ground opens up in a scary & wonderful way. Right?

It’s February. It’s a month of pinks, reds, and hearts all over! What will my theme for Global TV The Morning Show be when I’m on February 17th? I’m calling it [The Mathematics of Love](https://www.amazon.ca/Mathematics-Love-Patterns-Ultimate-Equation/dp/1476784884/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486846990&sr=8-1&keywords=the+mathematics+of+love) with a nod to the book of the same name.

## The Mathematics of Love

The book was fascinating. So much so that I learned that some mathematicians created [OKCUPID](https://www.okcupid.com/).  So as research … yes I’m pretending I’m a scientist … I created a profile on OKCUPID. After a week I removed my profile.  Man o man it’s a full time job going through all the stories and trying to decipher who could be my next date! Nevertheless, no more about me … unless you’re 6’ and … oh never mind!

[The Mathematics of Love](https://www.amazon.ca/Mathematics-Love-Patterns-Ultimate-Equation/dp/1476784884/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486846990&sr=8-1&keywords=the+mathematics+of+love) is a must-have for anyone who wants to better understand their love life as a mathematician pulls back the curtain and reveals the hidden patterns—from dating sites to divorce, sex to marriage—behind the rituals of love.

The roller coaster of romance is hard to quantify; defining how lovers might feel from a set of simple equations is impossible. However, that does not mean that mathematics isn’t a crucial tool for understanding love. Love, like most things in life, is full of patterns. In addition, mathematics is ultimately the study of patterns—from predicting the weather to the fluctuations of the stock market, the movement of planets or the growth of cities. These patterns twist, turn, warp, and evolve just as the rituals of love do.

In [The Mathematics of Love](https://www.amazon.ca/Mathematics-Love-Patterns-Ultimate-Equation/dp/1476784884/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486846990&sr=8-1&keywords=the+mathematics+of+love), [Dr. Hannah Fry](http://www.hannahfry.co.uk/) takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the patterns that define our love lives, applying mathematical formulas to the most common yet complex questions pertaining to love: What’s the chance of finding love? What is the probability that it will last? How do online dating algorithms work, exactly? Can game theory help us decide whom to approach in a bar? At what point in your dating life should you settle down?

Watch her [TED TALK](https://www.ted.com/talks/hannah_fry_the_mathematics_of_love) because it is a well-known fact that mathematicians are excellent at finding love.

From evaluating the best strategies for online dating to defining the nebulous concept of beauty, Dr. Fry proves—with great insight, wit, and fun—that math is a surprisingly useful tool to negotiate the complicated, often baffling, sometimes infuriating, always interesting, mysteries of love.

Did I find love? Nah. I was never good at math.

So let’s try chemistry now which is another subject I also do not excel at.

## Love  The Psychology of Attraction

This is a practical guide to successful dating and a happy relationship.  

Okay. How?  With easy and dynamic infographics that use the lessons of psychological research to help find a loving relationship. Sounds good.

The book starts with “Are you ready for love?” and examines the “scent of chemistry” and how smell works on our feelings. Then onto “The Search” including speed dating, chance encounters and personal ads.  On to Dating, Establishing the Relationship and Together!

As I'm reading this book, I'm listening to [CBC PODCAST PLAYLIST](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastplaylist) with one of my favourite morning men – [Matt Galloway](https://twitter.com/mattgallowaycbc?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) of [CBC METRO MORNING](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/programs/metromorning) and loving the valentine program (Feb 10) – I had tears in my eyes a few times.

Then keeping the radio on, I love the CBC & that doesn't make me feel like a cliff walker, I found [CBC RADIO ONE show NOW OR NEVER](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever) from the team who created another of my faves, DNTO.

Throughout the hour I listen to Lavanna, a 92 year old who is angry that her husband died and she has no one to talk to anymore. She writes an ad. She's lonely. She's get a call & "changes her pants and puts on some lipstick to go and meet someone new" because she says - 'why not'. She “misses talking to someone”. At the end of the hour ... it's a good thing to put yourself out there ... it's an experience. I certainly feel the same way albeit I think I'm more selective than Lavanna as I'm lucky to have my son living with me so I do have someone wonderful to talk to. In future - perhaps I'm meeting new men in the mall like Lavanna.

I have to recommend @CBCNowOrNever @TrevorCBC & @IfyTweets to keep up with the show! #loveCBC

![pianomaker Picture]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/pianomaker.jpg)

If you now need a novel to love rather than a person, may I suggest [THE PIANO MAKER](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-piano-maker/9780771071287-item.html?ikwid=the+piano+maker&ikwsec=Books&ikwidx=0).

It’s a suspenseful, emotionally resonant, and utterly compelling story of what brings an enigmatic French woman to a small Canadian town in the 1930s, a woman who has found depths of strength in dark times and comes to discover sanctuary at last. For readers of [The Imposter Bride](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/imposter-bride/9781443404037-item.html?ikwid=the+imposter+bride&ikwsec=Books&ikwidx=0), [The Cellist of Sarajevo](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-cellist-of-sarajevo/9780307397041-item.html?ikwid=The+Cellist+of+Sarajevo&ikwsec=Books&ikwidx=0), [Sarah’s Key](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/sarahs-key-a-novel/9780312370848-item.html?ikwid=Sarah%E2%80%99s+Key+by+Tatiana+de+Rosnay&ikwsec=Books&ikwidx=1) by Tatiana de Rosnay, and The Red Violin.

Helene Giroux arrives alone in St. Homais on a winter day. She wears good city clothes and drives an elegant car, and everything she owns is in a small trunk in the back seat. In the local church she finds a fine old piano, a Molnar, and she knows just how fine it is, for her family had manufactured these pianos before the Great War. Then her mother’s death and war forces her to abandon her former life.

The story moves back and forth in time as Helene, settling into a simple life, playing the piano for church choir, recalls the extraordinary events that brought her to this place. They include the early loss of her soldier husband and the reappearance of an old suitor who rescues her and her daughter, when she is most desperate; the journeys that very few women of her time could even imagine, into the forests of Indochina in search of ancient treasures and finally, and fatefully, to the Canadian north. When the town policeman confronts her, past and present suddenly converge and she must face an episode that she had thought had been left behind forever.

Have you fallen over the cliff and in love with my book suggestions?
