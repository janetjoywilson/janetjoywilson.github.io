## what makes you afraid?

When I think about what makes me afraid I immediately go to the monster under my bed. There was one when I was a kid. It lived in the house on the hill with us. My bed was high up for some reason and not only did it provide a large space for said monster but it was the reason I broke my collar bone (the first time).

“I am not afraid” is the quote that carried Cheryl Strayed through a 1,100 mile (1,770 km) hike on the Pacific Crest Trail when she was twenty-six years old.  She’s always thought of quotes as mini-instruction manuals for the soul.  I love that!  It’s quality rather than quantity right? She says, “Quotes, at their core, almost always shout YES!”

## wild

I took a copy of WILD with me on my annual “Wild Women in the Woods” trip to [Killarney](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/killarney) in 2012.  I remember reading the first pages inside our tent after a long day of canoeing & hiking through incredible wilderness.  I couldn’t believe what I was reading … my trip with 5 other women was luxury compared to Strayed’s journey alone on the PCT.  Her story is written with suspense, style, humour and honesty. I don’t have that copy anymore because I had to give it away so my girlfriends could start reading it - I wanted to talk about it! I personally enjoy getting lost when I travel as I usually find so much.

It’s also a beautiful book that doesn’t need gift wrapping.

## need more

“Trusting yourself means living out what you already know to be true.”

I trust myself not to embarass myself too much but back in January 2016 on "Blue Monday" I dressed myself ready to hike and promoted Strayed trio of books on Global TV The Morning Show. Watch my attempt to get you try something new [here](http://globalnews.ca/video/2460317/tms-book-club-11%20).

Stray from the course and try something new!  Why not? What do you have to be afraid of?
