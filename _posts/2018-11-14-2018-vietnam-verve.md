## Verve

Verve means lively and forceful enthusiasm, vigor and spirit, vitality.

My return journey to Vietnam began in January 2018. It was at the [Habitat for Humanity Canada](http://www.habitatglobalvillage.ca/about-global-village.php) office in Toronto that I was invited to lead my first team to Vietnam! I had trained for the role of a Team Leader last fall but I wasn't sure if I was going to lead a trip in 2018 as there was already so much happening in my world! At that time, I was recovering from Shingles and preparing for a trip to Russia to speak at the [Winter Cycling Congress](http://dandyhorsemagazine.com/blog/2018/02/20/winter-cycling-conference-report-from-russia-by-janet-joy-wilson/). But as you can guess, I said yes! I love saying YES because the door is open and an opportunity can present itself. If I had said no, I knew I'd regret the chance to go back to Vietnam.

## vui vẻ

Vui vẻ is pronounced vooy veh and mean "happy or elated" which I was certainly when I returned to the literary [Alcove Library Hotel](http://www.alcovehotel.com.vn/) in Ho Chi Minh City. It's a great little boutique hotel that offers a sanctuary of books within a chaotic city.

They have a great restaurant on the 5th floor with a delightful view. Their morning breakfast included coffee, lime juice, fruit, yoghurt, baguette, jams and a choice of a main western or Vietnamese meal. Wow, eh?!

On this particular morning, I selected the eggs benedict.

During these days/daze before the Vietnam Big Build (I'll explain what that means a bit later), I booked a couple of bicycle tours in the Mekong (meaning Mother River) Delta. It is a vast area in southwestern Vietnam encompassing over 40,500 square kilometres. The region has 12 provinces within it and is known as a biological treasure trove with over 1,000 animal species. It is also susceptible to flooding due to being a low-lying coastal area. The Climate Change Research Institute at Cần Thơ University, in studying the possible consequences of climate change, has predicted that, besides suffering from drought brought on by seasonal decrease in rainfall, many provinces in the Mekong Delta will be flooded by the year 2030.

## bicycle touring

Life in the Mekong Delta revolves around the river and many of the villages can only be reached by rivers and canals rather than by road. Cycling through the region on a bicycle allows for access that vehicles do not have.

Dragon fruit, also known as pitaya, is one of nature's most unique looking plants. It has a flower with an explosive looking flame and fruit like a pink rosebud. They come in three types all with a leathery, slightly leafy skin. There is a white and red flesh (which I tried and loved!) and a yellow flesh which I've never seen. Once cut they are incredibly easy to peel.

The fruit's texture is likened to a kiwifruit because of its black, crunchy seeds (rich in lipids). The Pitaya flowers bloom overnight and usually wilt by the morning. They rely on nocturnal pollinators such as bats or moths for fertilization. The plants can flower three to six times a year and as part of the cacti family, if a healthy piece of the stem is broken off, it may take root in soil and become its own plant. The stem looks and feels like an aloe plant.

## bananas

I love street food in Vietnam. My first of the bicycle trip was a quick stop for banana cake.

Fresh bananas. Battered and deep fried on a hot day. Did I tell you? It's 33C and we are cycling on a variety of trails that are paved, gravel and dirt. So a freshly made banana cake hit the spot.

Next we needed to quench our thirst!

The wonderful woman making us a sugar cane, kumquat & coconut drink over crushed ice is 72! After she pressed these three ingredients together, she sat cross legged next to me and touched my skin and laughed with us. Laughter is a universal language.

On top are peanuts! Truly this was the most delicious drink I've ever had.

The 23 km bicycle day ended. I wouldn't use this company again as their bicycles were not in great shape but for a one day tour right after 31 hours of travel, it satisfied my need to move after being confined in airports and on planes.

## cooking class

I really wanted to take a cooking class in Saigon as I love Vietnamese food! [MOM](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g293925-d12365770-Reviews-M_O_M_Cooking_Class-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html) (stands for mystery of mom) Cooking Class offered a start in the Cau Muoi market where we would shop with the locals.

![vietnam9]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/vietnam9.jpg)

After shopping, we had a welcome detox drink and then started to cook!

First we made chả giò miền and nước mắm chấm which is traditional spring roll with glass noodles and a dipping sauce with lime juice and coconut water.

![vietnam10]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/vietnam10.jpg)

The instructions were easy and well paced to keep us learning, laughing and then eating after each dish!

![vietnam11]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/vietnam11.jpg)

Next dish was my favourite! Gỏi Xoài Xanh which is green mango salad with dried anchovy. We learned how to use a super cool and dangerous tool that peeled the green mango.

![vietnam12]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/vietnam12.jpg)

There's a sauce for everything. The dressing for the green mango salad was nước mắm me trộn gỏi or fish dressing sauce with tamarind.

![vietnam13]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/vietnam13.jpg)

The salad included quail eggs! I made this. I really did and it was so flavourful!

We finished the morning with nem nuong or grilled patty skewer. A lot of work smashing the meat with a pestle until it is mixed and then you wrap it on the outside of lemongrass sticks. This was alongside tuong den dau phong nem nuong or dipping sauce with salted soya bean and chili oil.

![vietnam14]({{ site.url }}/images/blog/vietnam14.jpg)

The patty skewers were cooked over a flame on a charcoal cooker in the atrium of the building as it got very smoky!

It was an amazing morning and I have an even greater appreciation for Vietnamese food. If you're in Saigon, I'd highly recommend the [MOM Cooking Class](https://www.facebook.com/cookingclassbymom/). There's a different menu every day to cook!
