## Verve

Verve means lively and forceful enthusiasm, vigor and spirit, vitality.

My return journey to Vietnam began in January 2018. It was at the [Habitat for Humanity Canada](http://www.habitatglobalvillage.ca/about-global-village.php) office in Toronto that I was invited to lead my first team to Vietnam! I had trained for the role of a Team Leader last fall but I wasn't sure if I was going to lead a trip in 2018 as there was already so much happening in my world! At that time, I was recovering from Shingles and preparing for a trip to Russia to speak at the [Winter Cycling Congress](http://dandyhorsemagazine.com/blog/2018/02/20/winter-cycling-conference-report-from-russia-by-janet-joy-wilson/). But as you can guess, I said yes! I love saying YES because the door is open and an opportunity can present itself. If I had said no, I knew I'd regret the chance to go back to Vietnam.

## vui vẻ

Vui vẻ is pronounced vooy veh and mean "happy or elated" which I was certainly when I returned to the literary [Alcove Library Hotel](http://www.alcovehotel.com.vn/) in Ho Chi Minh City. It's a great little boutique hotel that offers a sanctuary of books within a chaotic city.

They have a great restaurant on the 5th floor with a delightful view. Their morning breakfast included coffee, lime juice, fruit, yoghurt, baguette, jams and a choice of a main western or Vietnamese meal. Wow, eh?!

On this particular morning, I selected the eggs benedict.

During these days/daze before the Vietnam Big Build (I'll explain what that means a bit later), I booked a couple of bicycle tours in the Mekong (meaning Mother River) Delta. It is a vast area in southwestern Vietnam encompassing over 40,500 square kilometres. The region has 12 provinces within it and is known as a biological treasure trove with over 1,000 animal species. It is also susceptible to flooding due to being a low-lying coastal area. The Climate Change Research Institute at Cần Thơ University, in studying the possible consequences of climate change, has predicted that, besides suffering from drought brought on by seasonal decrease in rainfall, many provinces in the Mekong Delta will be flooded by the year 2030.

## bicycle touring

Life in the Mekong Delta revolves around the river and many of the villages can only be reached by rivers and canals rather than by road. Cycling through the region on a bicycle allows for access that vehicles do not have.

Dragon fruit, also known as pitaya, is one of nature's most unique looking plants. It has a flower with an explosive looking flame and fruit like a pink rosebud. They come in three types all with a leathery, slightly leafy skin. There is a white and red flesh (which I tried and loved!) and a yellow flesh which I've never seen. Once cut they are incredibly easy to peel.

The fruit's texture is likened to a kiwifruit because of its black, crunchy seeds (rich in lipids). The Pitaya flowers bloom overnight and usually wilt by the morning. They rely on nocturnal pollinators such as bats or moths for fertilization. The plants can flower three to six times a year and as part of the cacti family, if a healthy piece of the stem is broken off, it may take root in soil and become its own plant. The stem looks and feels like an aloe plant.

## bananas

I love street food in Vietnam. My first of the trip was a quick stop for banana cake while cycling in the Mekong Delta.

Fresh bananas. Battered and deep fried on a hot day. Did I tell you? It's 33C on a variety of trails that are paved, gravel and dirt. So a banana cake freshly made hit the spot.

Next we needed to quench our thirst!

The wonderful woman making us a sugar cane & kumquoat & coconut drink over crushed ice is 72! After she pressed these three ingredients together, she sat with us cross legged and touched my skin and laughed with us. Laughter is a universal language.
