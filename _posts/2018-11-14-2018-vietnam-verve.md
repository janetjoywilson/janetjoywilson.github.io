## Verve

Verve means lively and forceful enthusiasm, vigor and spirit, vitality.

My return journey to Vietnam began in January 2018. It was at the [Habitat for Humanity Canada](http://www.habitatglobalvillage.ca/about-global-village.php) office in Toronto that I was invited to lead my first team to Vietnam! I had trained for the role of a Team Leader last fall but I wasn't sure if I was going to lead a trip in 2018 as there was already so much happening in my world! At that time, I was recovering from Shingles and preparing for a trip to Russia to speak at the [Winter Cycling Congress](http://dandyhorsemagazine.com/blog/2018/02/20/winter-cycling-conference-report-from-russia-by-janet-joy-wilson/). But as you can guess, I said yes! I love saying YES because the door is open and an opportunity can present itself. If I had said no, I knew I'd regret the chance to go back to Vietnam.

## vui vẻ

Vui vẻ is pronounced vooy veh and mean "happy or elated" which I was certainly when I returned to the literary [Alcove Library Hotel](http://www.alcovehotel.com.vn/) in Ho Chi Minh City. It's a great little boutique hotel that offers a sanctuary of books within a chaotic city.

They have a great restaurant on the 5th floor with a delightful view. Their morning breakfast (included in rate) included coffee, lime juice, fruit, yoghurt, baguette, jams and a choice of a main western or Vietnamese meal. Wow, eh?!

On this particular morning, I selected the eggs benedict.
