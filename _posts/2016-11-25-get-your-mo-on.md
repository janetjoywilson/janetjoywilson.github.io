## what does Movember mean to me?

I am the mum of an AHmazing young man!  All I want for him is to live a happy and healthy life.

How can I help this twenty year old now? All the nuturing and encouraging him to eat broccoli time is over ... kinda. I still make broccoli & put it in everything.

But now that he is an adult, I hope that he doesn't keep his pain inside. Whether it's physical or mental pain. Too many men don’t talk. They don’t take action and as a result die too young.

## the statistics

Prostate cancer kills 34 men every hour.

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men UNDER 40!

Every minute a man dies from suicide.

I was astounded to find out that MOVEMBER started with 30 moustaches in 2003 and is now at 5 million, this is now a global movement in 21 countries!

They’re the only charity tackling men’s health on a global scale, year round and they’re addressing some of the biggest health issues faced by men: prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and suicide prevention.

They know what works for men, and how to find and fund the most innovative research to have both a global and local impact. They’re independent of government funding, so they can challenge the status quo and invest quicker in what works. In 13 years they’ve funded more than 1,200 men’s health projects around the world.

## mo marvelous books

With all this mind, I have some books that would look good on your face & raise awareness in a bookish way:

## [Mr. Moustache](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/315975/mr-moustache#9780843180817) for ages 3-7

[Mr. Moustache](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/315975/mr-moustache#9780843180817) has a moustache, and he’s quite the gentleman. He’s polite, helpful, thoughtful, and generous. But when the barber shaves his ‘stache, Mr. Moustache suddenly doesn’t act the way he ought to. He slams the door on Mr. Nosey’s nose, and isn’t very nice to Little Miss Splendid. Could losing his moustache have made Mr. Moustache less of a gentleman? Good thing they grow back!

Don’t miss this fun book that includes a press-out moustache.

The late Roger Hargreaves created the Mr. Men series for his son, Adam, who currently oversees the estate and creates illustrations for new Mr. Men books.

## [Mo’s Moustache](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/225626/mos-mustache#9781101918555) for ages 3-7

Mo is a monster who just got a mustache. A big, black, beautiful mustache. Everybody likes Mo’s mustache. Now Knot, Dot, Nib, Tutu, Bob, Bill, and Ben all have mustaches too. In fact, soon EVERYBODY has a mustache! Why is everyone copying Mo? And how will he (and his mustache) ever stand out?

A wonderfully silly book about style and individuality, sure to grow on readers who don’t have facial hair – and even those who do!

“Monster + mustache = ‘Huzzah!’ With a soupçon of cool …. Requests for repeats are a certainty, and small ones will learn a lesson about individuality while enjoying this delightfully fun monster tale. Mo’s mustache? Magnifique!” - Starred Review, Kirkus Reviews

“Huzzah! Laugh-aloud funny, Clanton’s story also offers a way to begin discussing individuality or peer pressure.” - School Library Journal

## [Medicine](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/541740/medicine#9781465453419) – The Definitive Illustrated History

[Medicine](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/541740/medicine#9781465453419) tells the fascinating story of the discipline, from ancient times to the present day, charting developments in healing, diagnosis, surgery, and drugs in a vividly visual and accessible format.

Follow the gory pitfalls and the miraculous breakthroughs of medical history from trepanning, bloodletting, and body snatching to the latest developments in IVF and gene therapy. Clear diagrams explain major diseases, such as cancer, and enhance understanding of human anatomy, surgical instruments, and the progression of treatment over the centuries, setting the great milestones of medical history in their wider social context. A complementary illustrated reference section profiles all the main body systems and organs and explains their relevance in terms of the advancement of medicine.

A compelling blend of riveting stories, accessible information, and striking illustrations, [Medicine](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/541740/medicine#9781465453419) shows and tells how medicine has evolved into the lifesaving discipline it is today.

Put your moustache on for the sake of your father, uncle, brother, son, friend and neighbour.
