## meditation

I am returning to the [Ontario Vipassana Centre](http://www.torana.dhamma.org/) tomorrow to donate my time and my labour.

Why?

Read my [Travel Blog from February](http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/jsquaredink/7/tpod.html) for the answer.

How to end this post?  

It doesn't end ... it's a lifetime of learning and practicing ...

Courses are made possible by volunteers who serve the courses and by donations made by students who participate in them.

I am giving so that someone else may receive.

Bhavatu sabba mangalam : May all beings be happy!

Sadhu, sadhu, sadhu :  well said, well done; we agree, we share this wish.
