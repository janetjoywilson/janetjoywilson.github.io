## meditation

I am returning to the Vipassana meditation centre tomorrow to donate my time and my labour.

Why?

Read my [Travel Blog from February](http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/jsquaredink/7/tpod.html) for the answer.

How to end this post?  

It doesn't end ... it's a lifetime of learning and practicing ..

Bhavatu sabba mangalam : May all beings be happy!

Sadhu, sadhu, sadhu :  well said, well done; we agree, we share this wish.
