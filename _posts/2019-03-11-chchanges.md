Hello. Bonjour. Hej.

It's me.

Like Daylight Saving Time I am moving forward. 

Minute by minute.

Last week I was in front of students at Sir Oliver Mowat Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario. My goal, as instructed by the AWEsome English Teacher, was to inspire them. They will be preparing a Book Talk in this semester and was to provide some examples - in action - for them to consider.

I was relieved when the students asked questions. There were the standard 'what's your favourite book?' to 'do you have a novel in you?'. One question a challenge to answer as I have so many dear books that helped me throughout my life. The latter was easy as I am not a writer. Those skills are beyond me and so I shout about great books instead! I also managed to get teens on stage with me to share their love of a recent read. One boy shared his thoughts about [WONDER](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/wonder/9780375869020-item.html?s_campaign=goo-DSA_Books_Kids&ds_rl=1246160&ds_rl=1254699&ds_rl=1254699&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjpjkBRDRARIsAKv-0O0qWRe2pOyb_9-vXYcPGAPrezwXGVSTdJnVImUyJtL9upT7-Psj8-AaAjNJEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). It was interesting he remembered specific details whereas I recall the feelings I had while reading. 

Next week I'm on the expanded national edition of Global TV's The Morning Show. It's a Monday in March so I'll be talking about mitigating March Madness - it is a thing, isn't it?

I love talking about books but I am also a cycling advocate and I'll have my time on stage at the [Ontario Bike Summit](https://www.sharetheroad.ca/ontario-bike-summit-s15917). [Bike Minds](https://beyondtheautomobile.ca/bikeminds/) in partnership with [Share the Road](https://www.sharetheroad.ca/)  is presenting [Bikes+Community](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bike-minds-episode-7-bikescommunity-tickets-57933187724). Bike Minds is Torontoâ€™s bicycle-themed storytelling event, where guests share personal, positive, and inspiring stories related to cycling. I'll be sharing the pedal powered story of [The Reading Line](http://thereadingline.ca/).
