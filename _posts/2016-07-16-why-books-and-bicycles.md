## I love alliteration

I confess I have an addiction to alliteration. No, I am not in therapy for it as I think it adds to my charm. Yes, I am funny or so I think and with that said, books & bicycles fit perfectly together. I'm writing a bit of a bio below so that you know my history and maybe understand some of the choices I have made.

## farm girl

I have a distant memory of learning to read in the summer room of our farm house. We had an old school desk and chair where I practiced my writing and arithmetic. But my clearest memories include riding my pony, playing in the hay mow and shoveling the cow manure in the barn.

I was about eight or nine when I started taking tap dance lessons. First in a hall then in someone's kitchen and finally in Dunnville at the Sharon House School of Dance. The studio was in the basement of their house and I spent many hours learning choreography to group and solo dances and later teaching three year olds how to balance while doing a shuffle ball change. The reason I share this bit of history is that dancing opened up a new world for me that was far from the farm.  Kind of like what novels did for me later on. I remember a teacher reading out loud The Hobbit to our class. The story and the experience was extraordinary but that particular farm school didn't have a school library.

At this point in time, I have to be honest with you dear reader.  I changed schools in grade six because I had been bullied in our small town school. I kept quiet about it to my parents. Later I blocked out the memory. I only discovered this locked memory when I participated in a writing workshop at the age of 27. We used _Writing Down the Bones_ by [Natalie Goldberg](http://nataliegoldberg.com/about/) and it was my first experience with writing a stream of consciousness. This particular exercise started with "I don't remember..." which triggered remembering that year of my life! Maybe I should be in therapy!!!

Anyway, in my new school, my teacher, Mrs. Spears, took us to the library once a week and it was there that I would gather up five to six novels and inhale them throughout the week until I could choose six more! I was so hungry for stories. What author or book do I remember from that time? It was the 1970 novel by [Judy Blume](http://www.judyblume.com/) called _Are You There God? It's me, Margaret_, she spoke to me! I listened.

## english literature

I am so grateful for the outstanding teachers in my life. In Grade 11 and 12 I took ALL the English courses that Mr. MacDonald taught at CSS including his Grade 13 classes. I was reading and writing a lot of essays during those two years but I loved it and the thing I continue to look at today is the first and last line of a novel. During my high school years I was an athlete competing in track & field, cross country running and gymnastics along with figure skating. I also participated in 4H and Jr Farmers as I still loved our cows and my pony!  But I was studying dance in Buffalo and Toronto and ready to pursue a career in musical theatre but [How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgqVCJpRqWQ) after they've seen Paris?!

## acting

I don't seem content to learn only one thing so the dance led me to musical theatre which then made me want to study acting. I trained with various teachers in Hamilton, Ontario and then enrolled at York University. I was off the farm and in the city for good surrounded by a variety of people with a thirst for great plays.

My professional actor's resume includes children's theatre, new plays, commercials, television and film. My one feature film was directed by [Srinivas Krishna](http://divanifilms.com/) called [MASALA](http://divanifilms.com/film-tv/masala/) and was screened at [TIFF](http://tiff.net/). It was an extra-extraordinary experience!

## books

During my decade as an actor in Toronto, I paid my bills working as a 'temp' and it was during this time that I was hired by Madison Press Books located at that time on Madison Avenue in The Annex, Toronto, Ontario.  I answered the phone ... it really is the perfect temp job for an actor. You need a sophisticated voice or a tough gatekeeper, an actor is perfect! We learn a script quickly and are always pleasant to be around since we're still pursuing our dream of getting the next acting gig.

## bicycles

I worked at the Stratford Festival as a movement consultant in the summer of 1993 and I bought a blue bicycle. I rode it to the theatre. I explored the country's side roads. I had freedom on two wheels! I also almost got eaten alive by a doberman but that's another story.

Working in Toronto I had a car and I took the TTC. I did not ride my bicycle on the city streets. I only rode it on the trails which were safely away from traffic.

I married and in 1996 I had a son. A few years later when he had a bicycle sans training wheels, I got back on my bicycle to keep up with him. We also just biked along the trails beside the Humber River and Lake Ontario.

## today

I work for [Penguin Random House Canada](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/). In April 2013 I started to ride my bicycle to work every day downtown. It's a 30 km round trip through the city and along the lake. I got hooked on the feeling and the view from two wheels. I also saw first-hand the infrastructure needs in Toronto because there were more "Bike Lane Ends Here" signs than bike lanes! I became interested in making change as complaining is only more frustrating for me.

In April 2014 I became co-captain of [Cycle Toronto](https://www.cycleto.ca/) Ward 13 Bikes and began the long process of learning about the City of Toronto because that's how you can make change although I've been tempted to paint bike lanes myself over the years!

That summer [Amanda Lewis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-lewis-56942473) and I attended a Ward Captain meeting. I remember seeing her across the room and thinking - 'hey, we work together at PRHC. We should combine books & bicycles!' - she was also interested. We had lots of ideas and over a coffee [The Reading Line](www.thereadingline.ca) was born.

## tomorrow

I've given you more than enough background about me but be advised that I am informed by my past so that I want to include you ... I know what it's like to be excluded and it hurts.  Therefore I choose kind ... a reference to a favourite book of mine called [_Wonder_](http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/programs/tms-book-club/feature/wonder-wonder) by R.J. Palacio. She calls her book a "meditation on kindness" ... I really love that messsage.

I welcome you to my open book kind of life where I will share book and bicycle recommendations with you, dear reader.
