## close encounters

My first job in publishing was at [Madison Press Books](http://www.madisonpressbooks.com/aboutus.html) when it was on Madison Avenue in the Annex. I was an office temp working for PD Bureau in Toronto trying to make enough each month to pay my rent and hoping my acting income would buy me some food.
