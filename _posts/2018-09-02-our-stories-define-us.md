## sunrise or sunset

Which do you prefer? A sunrise or a sunset? Why?

I am partial to a sunrise because I feel I can start fresh. It's a tableau blanc.

This year we began our annual backcountry canoe trip in the north west area of [Killarney Provincial Park](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/killarney). The entire park is 645 square kilometres with the wild Georgian Bay Coast of pink granite; the La Cloche Mountains' white quartzite ridges and over 50 clear, sapphire lakes among a multitude of Jack Pines. No wonder the [Group of Seven](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/group-of-seven/) painted here and persauded the Ontario government to make it a park.
