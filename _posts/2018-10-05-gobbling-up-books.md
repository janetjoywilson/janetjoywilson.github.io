## I can't read fast enough

I binge on books.

I think I binge because I grew up on a farm and although we had some books, I don't remember ever going to a library. The school I attended until Grade 5 did not have one. We moved when I was going into Grade 6 and I remember the first week at my new school, [J.L. Mitchener Public School](https://jlmitchenerblog.wordpress.com/about/), in Cayuga. There was a library INSIDE the school! It was like candy to me! I was in Mrs. Spears class and I would take home a minimum of five books a week. I consumed those books as fast as I could as obviously I was starved!

Now my excuse today is that I work for a publisher of extraordinary literature and there is an embarrassment of great books around me all day long to binge on.

## BOOks

If you've ever played with a child, you know they love to be scared! My son squealed with delight when we peekaboo! DK Canada's [Pop-up Peekaboo! Pumpkin](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/538791/pop-up-peekaboo-pumpkin-by-dk/9781465452764) is a perfect Halloween surprise for the diapered trick and treaters.

The oversized board book is printed on heavy stock and has large flaps for little hands. The story promotes memory, imagination and tons of fun parent and child interactions. I think this kind of book is much better than a candy at Halloween!
