## journey

In May I went to Vietnam.

I cycled in the Mekong Delta with [Spice Roads](https://www.spiceroads.com/) with a guide/translator and a driver. It was Low Season so to be on a tour with me, myself & I was EXTRAordinary!!

The mighty Mekong spreads into tentacles and tributaries in southern Vietnam, making the delta fertile and the region one of Vietnam's highest producers of rice, vegetables and fruits. Cycling through rice paddies, orchards, along and over a myriad of small irrigation canals provided a unique view of Vietnam.

I worked as a volunteer to build a house with Habitat for Humanity.

VIETNAM IS A COUNTRY of divine contrasts. The scene changes from the bustling and chaotic streets of Hanoi in the north, down 3,450 km. of coastline to tranquil rice paddies and tropical islands in the south. Its difficult past has not stopped Vietnam from developing into a dynamic modern economy, thanks to the tenacity and determination of the Vietnamese people.

The country has experienced significant economic growth in the past two decades as the country shifted to a market-style economy. A driving force for the future is Vietnam’s strongly motivated and educated population—the country boasts a 90 percent literacy rate.

Even though Vietnam is one of the world’s fastest growing economies, there are presently 4.6 million poor households, according to the government’s own statistics. Recent data show that 7,000 billion dong (about US$433 million) in financial support is needed for 700,000 households living in poor conditions.

Habitat’s work in Vietnam is undertaken through a branch office of Habitat for Humanity International that was established in October 2002. Currently, Habitat has projects in the southern provinces of Kien Giang, Tien Giang, Dong Nai and Ho Chi Minh City. In the north, it is active in Vinh Phuc province. Earlier Habitat had a small operation in the coastal city of Danang, where 20 families were assisted through 2004.

To meet pressing housing and development needs in Vietnam, Habitat has a five-year strategic plan that aims to serve 18,000 families by 2011. This is being achieved through a combination of approaches that include the provision of housing microfinance services, vocational and technical training, as well as technical support in shelter, water and sanitation projects. Through these, Habitat is helping to transform communities by improving health and well-being, engaging women in decision-making, and involving community and youth groups in promoting civic society.

In March 2005, Habitat started a pilot project to reduce poverty levels in four districts of the southern province of Kien Giang. This initiative, with the help of the provincial authorities, extended existing microfinance networks so families could save and access credit for home improvements. The approach proved a speedy way to help hundreds of families. It is replicated in another pilot project in another southern province, Tien Giang, where more than 1,000 families are being provided with improved sanitation and housing.

Habitat has established a project office-and-resource center in the capital, Hanoi, to act as a catalyst for supporting new operations and partners in the north. In 2007, Habitat began hosting volunteers, both from within Vietnam and overseas. Habitat is also working to attract support from locally-based multinational corporations, local microfinance institutions and government partners already working with the urban and rural poor.

I cycled in Hoi An.

My life has been overflowing with exotic travel, events and emotions.
